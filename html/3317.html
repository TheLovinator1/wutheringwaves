 At Iuno's invitation, you ascend to the top of Tetragon Temple to gaze upon the starlit sky alongside her.

 Amidst drifting starlight where fate entwines with the constellations, she unveils the revelations and blessings hidden within Septimont's lunar phases…
</p>
<p>
 ""You're from Huanglong, right? Hehe, worry not. I can give you Huanglong-style moon readings.""
