 Dear Rovers,
</p>
<p>
 First, we want to express our heartfelt thanks for all your support and love for Wuthering Waves. It's crazy how time flies—we are already halfway through Version 1.2 "In the Turquoise Moonglow". We hope the Moonlit Fair has been a blast for you so far.
</p>
<p>
 While you are enjoying all the festivities, new stories are unfolding beyond the borders of Jinzhou. We have some awesome updates in the pipeline and we are excited to give you a sneak peek through this preview.

 In this preview, you can have a glimpse into the new area, gameplay features, and some storylines currently in development.

 The Black Shores, an archipelago enshrouded in mysteries and turmoil, remains sealed away from the world in thick digital fog. It is still uncertain when or who will lift its veil, allowing it to once more shoulder the task of connecting the world.
