 Fantasies of the Thousand Gateways:**
</h2>
<p>
 <strong>
  Adjusted Fantasies of the Thousand Gateways
 </strong>
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   Added a new method of obtaining Remnant Crystals. Each week, Fantasies of the Thousand Gateways provides 2 attempts to freely claim the first 2 rewards from Remnant Crystal without Waveplates. Free reward collections do not carry over to the next week. (※ A Waveplate-free attempt only provides one set of rewards.)
  </p>

  <p>
   In each Fantasies of the Thousand Gateways challenge, the number of attempts allowed for claiming Remnant Crystals has been increased from 2 to 4.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Adjusted the method of claiming certain rewards (after interacting with the Remnant Crystal); to claim the rewarded Random Echo, you now select a Tacet Field on the page and obtain the corresponding Echo. You must clear the target Tacet Field challenge and claim its original reward before you can claim the same set of rewards again from the interface.
  </p>
 </li>
