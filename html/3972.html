 After the Reactor Drive was set above Lahai-Roi by the Exostrider, it remained on high alert to the activities of Aleph-1.

 When the Drive's immune response is triggered, a mechanized "Reactor Husk" will arise from the depths of the energy well, with the sole purpose of eliminating intruders at all costs.
