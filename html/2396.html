 Event Details

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   As a member of the Black Shores, take on Crisis Trial challenges and Disaster Trial high-difficulty challenges under various combinations of Stress Modules.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In Crisis Trials, select a Stress Level for each trial. The Stress Level must meet the requirements to complete the trial. Each trial has a default Stress Module. Support Modules are available to lower the trial's difficulty. After completing a Crisis Trial, the corresponding Disaster Trial along with its Stress Module and Support Module will be unlocked.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Disaster Trials have no required Stress Level. Participating in a Disaster Trial will consume Support Modules, so select them carefully in advance.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Obtain Matrix Crystals by completing Challenge Goals in the Crisis and Disaster Trials. Matrix Crystals can be exchanged for rewards at the Supply Station. The Supply Station closes when this event ends. Please exchange your Matrix Crystals in time.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Completing certain Stress Level challenges in Disaster Trials will grant the event-exclusive Title ""Virtual Trailblazer.""
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 <em>
  Certain high-difficulty Stress Modules can only be unlocked after clearing a Disaster Trial. Equipping too many Stress Modules may make the trial excessively challenging.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  If a participant is downed in a trial, they can consume Stress Levels to revive. This also gives a corresponding buff. Please note that consuming Stress Levels will affect the completion and final result of Challenge Goals.
