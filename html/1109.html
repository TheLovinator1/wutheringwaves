 Dear Rover:
</p>
<p>
 Wuthering Waves Version 1.2 "In the Turquoise Moonglow" is on the horizon. Here's a sneak peek at the upcoming improvements and a special note from the dev team.
</p>
<h1>
 Version 1.2 Optimization Preview
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  1. New Custom Lock-On Feature
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In Version 1.1, we implemented several quality-of-life improvements to the auto lock-on system, including optimizations for Resonators and some Echo skills. With the release of Version 1.2, you'll gain access to the new Custom Lock-On feature under Settings - Control. This option allows you to set the auto lock-on priorities for enemies based on your combat preferences.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  2. New Utility Hoverdroid: Shooter
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 We've heard your feedback regarding the need to frequently switch between teams when there are no pistol-using Resonators available for challenges like the Photonvault and similar puzzles. In Version 1.2, you'll be able to use the new Hoverdroid: Shooter Utility.
</p>
<p>
 Once the Utilities feature is available, you can equip the Hoverdroid: Shooter in the Utility Wheel. To shoot with the Hoverdroid, simply tap or hold the Basic Attack button.
</p>
<p>
 More Hoverdroid features are under development. We hope this new addition will help your better explore Solaris.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  3. New Feature to Store Excess Waveplate
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 A new feature to store excess Waveplates will be introduced in Version 1.2. Once you reach the Waveplate cap, you will receive Waveplate Crystals instead. These Crystals can be exchanged for Waveplates of equivalent value.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You will regenerate 1 Waveplate Crystal every 12 minutes, up to 480 Waveplate Crystals. Once this limit is reached, you will not gain additional Waveplate Crystals.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  4. New Resonator Showcase Feature
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 With the release of Version 1.2, you can view and display the Convene scenes of unlocked Resonators with the Resonator Showcase feature.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Tap the avatar on the Terminal screen to open the Resonator Showcase. You can display up to 3 selected Resonators here.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  5. Option to Play at 120 FPS
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The 120 FPS option will be available on select PC devices in Version 1.2. Stay tuned for our official announcements for more availability details.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  6. New [Depths of Illusive Realm] Store Rewards
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Thank you for your love and support for Depths of Illusive Realm. As we approach the final stages of Version 1.1's Dreams Ablaze in Darkness event, the White Cat will bring new exchange items to the Illusive Store.
</p>
<p>
 To help you try out and level up more Resonators, we will add more exchange items to the Illusive Store in subsequent versions of the Depths of Illusive Realm event. These items will be available as the Convene events for the second half of each version are released.
</p>
<p>
 You will receive a system mail reminder after the exchange items are added. Please remember to exchange the rewards after fully exploring Depths of Illusive Realm.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  7. More Guidebook Activity Points from a Daily Quest
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 With the release of Version 1.2, the Activity Points reward for the "Spend 180 Waveplates" daily quest will be increased from +20 to +60. We hope this change will help you complete your daily Activity Points quests more quickly.
</p>
