<h1>
 New Resonators
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  5-Star Resonator: Augusta (Electro/Broadblade)
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Ephor of Septimont. The undying sun eternally ablaze, and a banner under which defeat does not exist.
</p>
<p>
 She comes. She sees. She conquers.
</p>
<p>
 With blade held high, she awaits the next challenger or the fate that claims it cannot be defied.
</p>

  5-Star Resonator: Iuno (Aero/Gauntlets)
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 She is favored by fate under one name, and swept away by it in another.
</p>
<p>
 Yet never once has she been defeated, nor has she ever yielded.
</p>
<p>
 Now, witness the defiant Priestess. Witness what keeps her striding forward, never to look back. Witness how she walks the intricate web of destiny and becomes the only answer.

 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  5-Star Weapon: Moongazer's Sigil (Gauntlets)
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 By what means do all things endure? By light and heat, by matter and word, by the mechanics of converging chances, by the soft dissolution into silence, by a moment that mimics the eternal... All things rise and fall in endless rhythm, each bearing its meaning. As for hers, it lies here within her grasp.
