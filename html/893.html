 Dear Rover,
</p>
<p>
 To give you a sneak peek into what we have in store for you in future updates, we'll share the latest adjustments we're making to the game via Developer's Messages before each new version's launch. We'll also use these messages to address common issues with the current version and share details on related optimizations and adjustments.
</p>
<p>
 Wuthering Waves Version 1.1 "Thaw of Eons" is right around the corner. Here's what to expect in the new version:
</p>
<h1>
 Echo System
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  I. New Tuner Synthesis Feature
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 To address the issue of lower-grade Tuners piling up in your Backpack during the late game, we will be introducing the Tuner Synthesis feature in the Version 1.1 update. With this feature, you will be able to synthesize a certain number of Medium/Advanced Tuners into higher-grade Tuners using the Synthesizer.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  II. Increased Union EXP Reward for Unlocking New Echo Entries
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 To the leveling experience and unlock the late-game content earlier for all players, we have introduced Union EXP reward for unlocking new entries of Echoes as of Version 1.1.
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, we will retrospectively reward the Union EXP for the number of Echo entries you have unlocked during Version 1.0 after the update. The compensation will be distributed via in-game mail. Make sure to check your mail and claim the rewards in time!
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  III. Higher COST Range for Echoes Rewarded for Activity Points
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 We've heard your feedback about the high variability in the COST range of Echo rewarded by gaining required Activity Points in Guidebook. To improve your experience, we have removed COST 1 Echoes from the Activity Points reward pool. Now only COST 3 – COST 4 Echoes will be rewarded as for Activity Points.
</p>
<p>
 After the Version 1.1 update, once you accumulate 100 Activity Points by completing the Guidebook tasks, you will receive a random Echo of COST 3 or COST 4 quality.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  IV. Data Bank Level Cap Raised
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 After the Version 1.1 update, the level cap for the Data Bank will be raised to Lv. 21. After reaching Lv. 21, all Echoes dropped will be guaranteed to be of 5-Star Rarity.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  V. New Fun in Mt. Firmament: Echo Transformation
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Get ready for some fun! In select areas of Mt. Firmament, you can now transform into Echo "Clang Bang" to explore the area. Stay tuned for more creative Echo puzzles and challenges in future updates!
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  VI. Other Optimizations
 </strong>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   Removed Tacet Field reward collection animation. You may now collect the reward directly.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Lowered Shell Credit Cost for Echo leveling.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Simplified the Cruisewing Challenge. We have slowed down the flying speed of the Cruisewing and extended the time limit to make the challenge more manageable.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<h1>

<h1>
 Map Exploration System
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  I. New Mt. Firmament Layered Map
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Due to the complexity of Version 1.1's new map Mt. Firmament, we've added the layered map feature to the area to help you better explore it. You can switch between different layers on the map for more detailed exploration guidance.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Due to the volume of work involved in creating a layered map for all areas, the Layered Map for other areas in Jinzhou will be released in future updates."

</ul>
<p>
 <strong>
  II. New Area Quest Progress
 </strong>

<p>
 <strong>
  III. Expanded Detection Range for Lootmapper

</p>
<h1>

 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 To unlock the late-game content early for all players, we will lower the level requirements for some Main Quests after the Version 1.1 update:
</p>
<p>
 The requirement to unlock Main Quest Chapter 1 Act 4: Clashing Blades will be lowered from Union Lv. 14 to Union Lv. 11. Main Quests Chapter 1 Act 5 and Act 6 will become available once the preceding chapter quests are completed.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  IV. More Number and Types of Guidebook: Activity Points Quests
 </strong>
</p>
<p>

<p>
 <strong>
  I. New Combat Style Tags

</p>
<p>

 To make the chat system easier to use during gameplay, the chatbox will be displayed at a half-screen height after the Version 1.1 update.
