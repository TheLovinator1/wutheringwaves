   All the game content in CBT2 is still under development and does not represent the final quality of the game.

   There will be no voiceover for the main story in CBT2. When Wuthering Waves officially launches, English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese dubbing languages will be available. The developer team will strive to bring you better voiceover quality. We appreciate your support and understanding!

   Sharing, lending, giving away, transferring, or selling test qualifications, accounts, clients, and other related actions are strictly prohibited during CBT2. Any users found engaging in such behaviors will have their qualification cancelled. To ensure the security of your personal information and assets, we remind you not to believe or engage in any activities related to sharing/trading of qualifications, account sharing/trading, or selling of test packages. This will help you avoid unnecessary losses.

 We will make another announcement once we have completed distributing all CBT2 Qualifications. Please stay tuned!
