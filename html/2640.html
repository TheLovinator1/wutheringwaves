<ul>

  <p>
   [Through Verses and Rhythms] is a Featured Resonator Convene event banner. Use Radiant Tide to convene. You are guaranteed at least one 4-Star or higher rarity Resonator or Weapon every 10 attempts.

 <li>
  <p>
   The Guarantee count is shared among all [Anniversary Resonator Convene] and [Featured Resonator Convene] event banners. If a 5-Star Resonator is not obtained in this event banner, the Guarantee count is carried over across other [Anniversary Resonator Convene] and [Featured Resonator Convene] event banners and resets once a 5-Star Resonator is obtained.

 <li>
  <p>
   Featured Resonator Ciaccona is exclusive to the [Through Verses and Rhythms] Featured Resonator Convene and will not be available by other means once the event ends.

 <li>
  <p>
   Featured Resonator Ciaccona's Waveband will be simultaneously made available in the Afterglow Coral Store with a limit of 2 purchases, and it will be removed once the Convene event ends.
