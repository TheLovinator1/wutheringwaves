 Closed Beta II is scheduled to start on 2024/2/19 at 10:00 (UTC+8). Qualified applicants can log in to the game on the specified platform using the same login method as when filling out the Recruitment Questionnaire. If you come across a "Waiting for Test Opening" prompt when launching the game, it indicates that CBT2 has not started yet. Please be patient and wait for its official opening.
