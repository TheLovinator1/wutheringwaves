<p>
 Dear Rovers,
</p>
<p>
 Greetings, we are the Wuthering Waves Dev Team. Since the official launch of Wuthering Waves, we have received a lot of valuable feedback and suggestions through social media and in-game surveys. We are genuinely grateful for your attention and support.
</p>
<p>
 We apologize for the deficiencies and issues present in Wuthering Waves, our first fully independently developed and globally published game at Kuro Games. We understand that this has affected your gaming experience, and we are working to improve it for those who love the game.
</p>
<p>
 We have been working on optimizations and iterations for the current 1.0 version, and the development of subsequent version updates is also underway. Below, we will address some of the most discussed and concerned issues.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  I. On the Echo Development Experience
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  (1) Echo Development feels grindy and inadequate energy materials
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 We are aware of the common concern in the community that the current Echo leveling experience feels too grindy and the game lacks a Waveplates storage system. We have confirmed and will implement the following adjustments while we are working internally on solutions to address other common concerns.
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   In the current version, we will launch a limited-time Echo material double yield event "Chord Cleansing";
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In version 1.1, we will adjust the progression system to reduce the Shell Credit costs of Echo development;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In version 1.1, we will remove the reward cutscene of the Tacet Field;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   From version 1.1 and forward, the yield of Echoes and Echo development materials will be increased;
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In upcoming updates, we will introduce the Waveplates storage system.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <strong>
  (2) Regarding our handling of the reward system error when recycling developed Echoes
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 On May 29, 2024, we were notified of an issue with the Echo recycling system where the amount of Shell Credits players obtained when recycling developed Echoes was wrong. Since this is an issue that directly impacts the game's balance, we fixed this problem through an emergency live update on the same night and issued compensation to all players. As part of the measures to minimize the event's impact on the fairness within the player community, we informed the players of the situation and announced that we would remove all additional Shell Credits obtained unexpectedly as a result of this bug within 14 business days and issue compensations accordingly.
</p>
<p>
 However, due to the urgency of this issue, we failed to issue an announcement of this issue in the first instance, which regrettably caused negative experiences for our players. We sincerely apologize for our improper way of handling this situation and the inconvenience caused.
</p>
<p>
 Following an internal discussion, we have decided to compensate all players with the Shell Credit based on the maximum amount of Shell Credit that had been unexpectedly yielded through this bug to address the negative impact caused. We will round up to the nearest whole number and provide
 <strong>
  extra compensation
 </strong>
 to all players:
 <strong>
  Shell Credit ×1,000,000
 </strong>
 .
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Distribution Time: By 23:59 on June 10, 2024 (UTC+8)
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Eligibility: Character created and mailbox function unlocked before 10:00 on May 30, 2024 (UTC+8). The compensation is valid until 05:59 on July 3, 2024 (UTC+8).
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 We apologize again for the hasty way we handled this issue and for any inappropriate wording in our announcements. We promise that all our future decisions shall reflect thorough consideration and professionalism.
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, to address the poor experience with the Echo system, we will compensate all Rovers with
 <strong>
  Crystal Solvents ×20 (1 Crystal Solvent = 60 Waveplates)
 </strong>
 . Thank you for your understanding and support!
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Distribution Time: 10:00 on June 3, 2024 (UTC+8)
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Eligibility: Mail function unlocked. The compensation is valid until 05:59 on June 28, 2024 (UTC+8).
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  II. On the Error in 5-Star Weapon Description
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 As has been discovered by our players, the description of the 5-Star Weapon "Verdant Summit" in the game in certain languages contained a mistranslation. Upon discovering this issue, we promptly corrected the description and issued compensations to all Rovers. We have also initiated a comprehensive internal review of the localized versions of the in-game texts across all the languages that we support. Any corrections or improvements made during the process will be included in the upcoming updates. We sincerely apologize for this mistake and want to reassure you that we're committed to continuously improving the quality of our localization to better the experience for all Rovers.
</p>
<p>
 In the meantime, we will offer
 <strong>
  a one-time compensation of Forging Tides ×5
 </strong>
 to all Rovers for the known localization issue.
</p>
<p>
 As we endeavor to constantly improve the localization quality across different languages, we encourage you to provide us with your comments or suggestions on improving the localization and the experience of players worldwide through in-game feedback channels or our Customer Support. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
</p>

 </strong>
 , after which we will schedule a server downtime and implement the update for Wuthering Waves Version 1.1 "Thaw of Eons", which will include a

 <strong>
  V. On Combat and Control Experience Optimization
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 We have heard your feedback regarding the poor experience with autoaiming and auto lock-on, controls, key remapping requirements, and game feel design. Based on the issues that repeatedly come up in player discussions, we have identified the following issues and will address them accordingly, while working on a solution to other known issues not listed below.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  (1) Autoaiming/Auto Lock-on and Camera Performance In Battle
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In the recent updates, we have disabled the "Combat Camera Correction" feature on PC by default. We have also optimized the default values and ranges for combat camera settings.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  (2) Bosses Existing Combat State Unexpectedly
 </strong>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   In recent updates, we have optimized the aggro ranges for certain bosses, including "Thundering Mephis," "Crownless," "Lampylumen Myriad," and "Impermanence Heron" and adjusted the prerequisites for enemies to leave the combat combat state to reduce abnormal disengagements.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   In upcoming updates, we will introduce a "Disengagement Warning" feature.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <strong>
  (3) Ghost Touch Issues on Mobile
 </strong>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   In recent updates, we have expanded the anti-ghost touch area around buttons.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Future versions will include further optimizations for mobile controls.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <strong>
  (4) Delayed Availability of Custom Keybinding Feature
 </strong>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   In version 1.1, the prerequisite to unlock the "Custom Keybinding" feature will be lowered to Union Level 2.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   We will also introduce a new player tutorial for using the "Custom Keybinding" feature, and we will gradually support more custom keybinding options for both keyboard/mouse and controller modes.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <strong>
  (5) Controller Mode Experience Optimization
 </strong>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   In version 1.1, we will remap the current controller shortcut of "Open Chat" to "Open Map" and add an option to invert the Y-axis.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Future versions will support "Controller Mode" on mobile devices.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <strong>
  (6) Poor Game Feel Design and Impact Signification
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In future versions, we will constantly improve the event signification and game feel design for characters and monsters, enhancing the overall combat experience and positive feedback during battles.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  VI. On Other Contents
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  (1) No Purchase Limits for Store Items Like "Flour", Leading to Accidental Purchases
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In recent updates, we have added a "Weekly Purchase Limit" for certain items in the store.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  (2) Audio and Sound Effect Bugs
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In recent updates, we have addressed issues regarding missing sound effects and excessively loud ambient sounds. We have completed some investigations and updates to fix these issues. We will continue to optimize the audio experience to provide a more immersive audiovisual experience.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  (3) Performance Issues: Crashes and Instability
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In recent updates, we have fixed crash and instability issues affecting certain devices. We are currently identifying the causes of other crash reports and will continue to implement fixes. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. We are committed to ongoing performance optimization. If you encounter related issues when gaming, please contact Customer Support for assistance.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  (4) "Depths of Illusive Realm" Event Optimization and Updates
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 We have received numerous player feedback and suggestions regarding the "Depths of Illusive Realm" event in version 1.0. In the upcoming version 1.1 update, we will further improve this event and add new content, including more playable characters, new challenges, new mechanics, and new buffs.
</p>
<p>
 Apart from the adjustments mentioned above, we recognize that there are still many issues in the game that affect player experience. We are committed to listening to every single piece of feedback, continuously organizing, optimizing, and resolving these issues to make Wuthering Waves better.
</p>
<p>
 We will share and communicate future updates and optimization progress with you actively. Additionally, we will continue to gather player feedback through version surveys.
</p>
<p>
 Since Wuthering Wave's official global launch, we have been disheartened by our inability to provide a high-quality gaming experience to all Rovers. We understand that continuously releasing better versions and content is our goal and mission, and we will always strive to uphold them.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, we sincerely thank all Rovers for your continuous attention and unwavering support for Wuthering Waves.
