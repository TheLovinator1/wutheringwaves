 ✦How to Participate✦
</h3>
<p>
 In order to successfully complete the V1.2 WUWA Discord Quest, players who meet the eligibility criteria must live stream their Wuthering Waves gameplay to a friend via a Discord voice channel for a minimum duration of 15 minutes on the desktop app.
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   Before you can begin the Quest, launch the game.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Then, head to your Discord desktop app and navigate to a direct message (DM), group chat, or a server of your choice.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Once there, start a voice call or join a voice channel and select the Screen Share icon located in the voice status panel. Be sure to select the individual application for the game before you Go Live.

 .
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Q: Is this feature/promotion available in my region?
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 A: Some Quests will not be available in all regions based on terms and conditions. If you are in an ineligible region for a Quest, you will not be able to complete it.
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, Discord’s premium services are restricted in some regions. If you are unable to access the Gift Inventory, you are not eligible for Quests.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Q: I have concerns or questions regarding privacy and Quests.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 A: We encourage you to review

 article, to learn more about how we use data for Quests.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Q: Why am I unable to complete Quest while using Linux?
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 A: Currently, Quest rewards are unable to be earned on Linux devices.
</p>
<p>
 However, Discord team is looking into a resolution for this issue so that earning Quest rewards is possible on Linux in the future. For now, we recommend completing the requirement on a different operating system, like Windows or MacOS.
</p>
<p>
 Discord support team does not have an exact ETA for when a solution will be available, and won't be able to provide any status updates on this specific issue.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Q: I no longer see a Quest. Where did it go?
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 A: Quests are typically only available for a limited amount of time. If you no longer see a Quest in the Quest Home or in-app notifications about the quest, the period to complete and claim the reward for the Quest is over.
