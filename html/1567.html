<p>
 Dear Rovers,
</p>
<p>
 Thank you for your continued support for Wuthering Waves. With Version 1.4: When the Night Knocks just around the corner, it's time for another installment of Wuthering Waves Developer's Message. In this update, we're adding new gameplay elements, an exciting new feature, and optimizations to enhance your experience.
</p>
<h1>
 New Gameplay Elements
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  New Combat Mechanism: Dream Link
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Dream Link is a new combat mechanism that will be introduced in the Main Event of Version 1.4. Dream Link enhances the synergy between your Resonators, allowing them to unlock their true potential together. When certain conditions align during combat, Dream Link will activate, dramatically amplifying your team’s combat prowess.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Overdrive Combat: Illusive Sprint
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 In the Main Event of Version 1.4, you can pick up the white cat's blessings to enter the Illusive Sprint state that increases your moving speed. Lumi, a Resonator who will make her debut in the new version, has a similar ability. When certain requirements are met, instead of dodging, Lumi dashes to get out of harm's way and is capable of attacking enemies while moving at high speed.
</p>
<p>
 These two new gameplay mechanisms will be available in the Main Event of Version 1.4. Once the Main Event concludes, it will be added as a Permanent Event, where the same gameplay mechanisms will still be available.
</p>

 New Feature
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  Weapon Cosmetics: Weapon Projection
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 With Version 1.4, we’re introducing an exciting new customization feature: Weapon Projections. This feature lets you transform the appearance of your weapons without affecting their stats, allowing you to create a look that’s entirely your own.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Participate in the Main Event of Version 1.4 to obtain a free Weapon Projection associated with the event featured 4-Star Sword.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, we are adding Transparent Weapon Projections, available for all five weapon types. You can use a Transparent Weapon Projection to turn the equipped weapon completely or partially invisible. We hope these new options let you add even more personality to your Resonators’ looks, whether you're exploring or capturing moments in photos.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Participate in Version 1.4's Depths of Illusive Realm to obtain a complete set of Transparent Weapon Projections for free.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Equip a Transparent Weapon Projection to make Rectifiers and Gauntlets completely invisible, or turn Swords, Broadblades, or Pistols partially transparent.
 </em>

 Gaming Experience Optimizations
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  Leveling-related Optimizations: Double Rewards, Step-by-Step Echo Upgrade
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 To enhance your long-term gaming experience, Version 1.4 will introduce a series of leveling-related optimizations as part of an ongoing project. In this update, you’ll be able to Fast Travel directly to the location of any Tacet Suppression or Boss challenge via the Map.
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, you’ll have the option to spend double the Waveplates to earn double rewards upon completing a Forgery, Simulation, or Tacet Suppression challenge. We've also improved the display of Results Screens, giving you a clearer view of the rewards you've earned.
</p>
<p>
 Last but not least, in Version 1.4, you can conveniently upgrade an Echo to the exact levels that unlock new substats (5/10/15/20/25) through the Auto-Select Settings. We hope this change can improve your Echo Upgrade experience and efficiency.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Interface-related Optimizations: Waveplate Info Pop-up, Echo Info Pop-up, Tower of Adversity Interface Adjustments
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Starting from Version 1.4, whenever you log into the game, you'll receive a pop-up displaying the amount of Waveplates and Waveplate Crystals you own.
</p>
<p>
 The displayed information for a newly absorbed Echo will also be optimized. Upon absorption, the Echo's Sonata Effect category will be displayed along with its Mainstat and Substat.
</p>
<p>
 In the current version, adjusting your team lineup in the Tower of Adversity requires leaving and re-entering, which we know can interrupt your gameplay experience. To improve this, we've optimized the interface in the upcoming version, allowing you to view and adjust your team directly within the Tower.
</p>
<p>
 Apart from the above, more optimizations are in the pipeline, along with more gameplay elements and features. Please stay tuned!
