  Q8: If I change devices during CBT2, can I continue playing on the new device?
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 A8: Here are the explanations regarding device and qualification binding:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   After the start of this test, each Rover can play the game on one device on both PC and mobile platforms. The test data is shared between the PC and mobile platforms.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The CBT2 qualification will be bound to the device you first log in to the game with. During the test, you cannot change the device within the same platform.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Changing devices or account bindings during the test will result in the game account being banned, and unlocking the account during CBT2 will not be possible. Additionally, reinstalling the system, upgrading the system, or changing device hardware during the test may also result in log-in failures.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   There is no appeal process available for CBT2, and once an account is banned, it cannot be unlocked.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <em>
  To ensure the security of your personal account information and assets, we remind you not to believe in any information regarding sharing/trading of qualifications, account sharing/trading, or selling of test packages. This will help you avoid unnecessary losses.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Q9: Can I publish the game content I experienced during CBT2, such as live streams, screenshots, and videos, on social media platforms?
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
