<p>
 Rinascita
</p>
<p>
 Ragunna, in southern Rinascita, holds the closest bond with their Sentinel Imperator among the nation's many city-states. Most Ragunnesi worship the Sentinel, viewing Common Echoes as divine blessings. Ragunna is also home to the Order of the Deep, widely regarded as the Sentinel's earthly emissaries.
</p>
<p>
 The Black Shores report that the Threnodian in Ragunna remains dormant. In recent years, however, even Sentinel Imperator has fallen silent, no longer speaking directly to the Ragunnesi...
