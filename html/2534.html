<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   [Absolute Pulsation] is a Featured Weapon Convene event. Use Forging Tide to convene. You are guaranteed at least one 4-Star or higher rarity Resonator or Weapon every 10 attempts.

   The Guarantee count is shared among all [Anniversary Weapon Convene] and [Featured Weapon Convene] event banners. If a 5-Star Weapon is not obtained in this event banner, the Guarantee count is carried over across other [Anniversary Weapon Convene] and [Featured Weapon Convene] event banners and resets once a 5-Star Weapon is obtained.

 <li>
  <p>
   The 5-Star Weapon you Convene is guaranteed to be Blazing Justice.
  </p>
 </li>

   Featured Weapon Blazing Justice is exclusive to the Featured Weapon Convene and will not be available by other means once the event ends.
