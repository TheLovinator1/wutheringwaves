 Dear Rover,
</p>
<p>
 To bring you exciting new content and a better gaming experience, we will soon be conducting the update maintenance for Version 2.5: Unfading Melody of Life.
</p>
<p>
 During the maintenance, you will be unable to log in to the game, so please plan your time accordingly. Additionally, due to the large size of the update, we recommend updating the game while connected to a Wi-Fi network. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  [Maintenance Time &amp; Compensation Details]
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Maintenance Time: 2025-07-24 04:00 - 2025-07-24 11:00 (UTC+8)
