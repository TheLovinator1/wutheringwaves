 New Area
</h1>
<p>
 Mt. Firmament
</p>
<p>
 Beyond the southeastern sea of Jinzhou lies the secluded realm of Mt. Firmament. It is said that Sentinel Jué once graced this ancestral homeland of the Jinzhou people with its presence.
</p>
<p>
 Now, however, this snowy peak is perpetually shrouded in mist, sealed away from commoners. Rumor has it that time flows eerily slowly there, almost as if it is stagnant...
