  <p>
   Changing devices or account bindings during the test will result in the game account being banned, and unlocking the account during CBT2 will not be possible. Additionally, reinstalling the system, upgrading the system, or changing device hardware during the test may also result in log-in failures.
  </p>

  <p>
   There is no appeal process available for CBT2, and once an account is banned, it cannot be unlocked.
