</p>
<p>
 Additionally, Discord’s premium services are restricted in some regions. If you are unable to access the Gift Inventory, you are not eligible for Quests.

<p>
 Q: Why am I unable to complete Quest while using Linux?
</p>
<p>
 A: Currently, Quest rewards are unable to be earned on Linux devices.
</p>
<p>
 However, Discord team is looking into a resolution for this issue so that earning Quest rewards is possible on Linux in the future. For now, we recommend completing the requirement on a different operating system, like Windows or MacOS.
</p>
<p>
 Discord support team does not have an exact ETA for when a solution will be available, and won't be able to provide any status updates on this specific issue.
</p>
<p>
 Q: I no longer see a Quest. Where did it go?
</p>
<p>
 A: Quests are typically only available for a limited amount of time. If you no longer see a Quest in the Quest Home or in-app notifications about the quest, the period to complete and claim the reward for the Quest is over.
