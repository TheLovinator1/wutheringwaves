  [Version Update Details]
 </strong>
</p>
<h1>
 New Resonator
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  5-Star Resonator: Phrolova (Havoc/Rectifier)
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Phrolova, a Fractsidus Overseer walking the fine line between life and death, an uncanny, deadly conductor.
</p>
<p>
 A silent wave of her baton is enough to attune the very frequencies of being and conduct the symphonies of "souls." The music of hers can sculpt a better world or, just as easily, summon a legion to wreak havoc.
</p>
<h2>
 Combat Roles: Main Damage Dealer, Resonance Skill DMG, Havoc DMG Amplification, Heavy Attack DMG Amplification
</h2>
<p>
 <em>
  Obtainable through the [Requiem Without End] Featured Resonator Convene.

 New Weapon
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  5-Star Weapon: Lethean Elegy (Rectifier)
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 I am not there. I do not die.
</p>
<p>
 I shall be death's companion—with euphoric delights I drown my fear, with the coming days I trade for the past.
</p>
<p>
 <em>

 New Location
</h1>
<p>
 <strong>
  [Fabricatorium of the Deep]
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 A hidden facility at the depths of the sea. It serves as the distribution center for the Common Echoes. Few truly understand its full purpose.
</p>
<p>
 Beneath the calm lies madness, and at the end of the madness is a collection of unfulfilled, lingering desires.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Reach the location during Main Quest Chapter II Act VII: Dreamcatchers in the Secret Gardens.

<h2>
 [Fabricatorium of the Deep] New Way of Exploration

 Orchestration: In Fabricatorium of the Deep areas, use a special Utility to Orchestrate and change the status of objects, so that you can get past mechanisms or gain advantages in combat.
</p>
<p>
 Orchestration Altar: Everything is made of frequencies, as Phrolova claims. Interact with Orchestration Altars and return the notes to their right order to change the status of a door or mechanism and access more explorable areas.

<p>
 <strong>
  [Main Quest] Chapter II Act VII: Dreamcatchers in the Secret Gardens
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 The Dreamer seals her heart and surrenders to a world of dreams beyond mortal sight. In this hidden realm built upon melancholy melodies, she walks a path of fragile hope and delusions without looking back. But the dreams she longs to realize have long been tangled up in shadow and deceit. Beneath the lofty facade of the Orchestrator, who seems to have everything, is but a wretched, pitiful soul, drowning in her own illusions.
</p>
<p>
 In the end, will this dream of blooming and withering be a sweet reverie or a haunting nightmare?
