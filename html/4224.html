 To help Startorch freshmen learn to drive safely, the Biological Mechanical Exoswarm Materials Manufacturing and Research Club developed H.E.R.M.E.S., a motorbike simulator running on heuristic algorithms. But due to some issues with the model's training data, the system accidentally became sentient and refused to be driven. In their last-ditch effort, the developer reached out to you for help with the testing.
