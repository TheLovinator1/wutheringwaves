 Dear Rover,
</p>
<p>
 To bring you exciting new content and a better gaming experience, we will soon be conducting the update maintenance for Version 2.4: Lightly We Toss the Crown.
</p>
<p>
 During the maintenance, you will be unable to log in to the game, so please plan your time accordingly. Additionally, due to the large size of the update, we recommend updating the game while connected to a Wi-Fi network. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  [Maintenance Time &amp; Compensation Details]
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Maintenance Time: 2025-06-12 04:00 - 2025-06-12 11:00 (UTC+8)
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Maintenance Compensation: Astrite x300, Crystal Solvent x2
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Compensation Eligibility: Create a character and unlock the Mails feature before 2025-06-12 04:00 (UTC+8). The compensation can be claimed before the next version update.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ※In the event that the maintenance is extended, the dev team will issue a follow-up notice and adjust the compensation accordingly.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  [How to Update]
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Once the maintenance for the version update begins, you can follow the following instructions to update your client.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦PC: Close the game, restart the launcher, and then click on "Update."
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Android: Launch the game and follow the instructions in the update pop-up window to complete the update.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦iOS: Download/update the game in the App Store.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Mac: Download/update the game in the App Store.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦PS5™: Open the home screen &gt; Select Wuthering Waves &gt; Press the OPTIONS button to Check for Update.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  [Pre-download]
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Start Time: 2025-06-10 10:00 (UTC+8)
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  [Pre-download Storage Requirements]
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦PC: 19 GB. To ensure smoother subsequent processes, such as decompressing, it is recommended that you have at least 38 GB of spare storage space on your PC.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Android/iOS: 11 GB. Approximately 22 GB of storage space is needed for the decompression process. This space will be used only temporarily and will be freed up once the maintenance is completed.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  If your mobile device does not have enough spare storage space during the pre-download process or at its conclusion, merging, decompressing, or verifying files contained in the incremental resource package may fail, leading to the initiation of the downloading of the full resources. Please ensure that your mobile device has enough spare storage space. The full resources are larger in size (approximately 31 GB) and may take longer to download. The pre-download feature will be further optimized in future versions. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience you may experience in the meantime.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  [How to Pre-download]
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦PC: When pre-download for the latest version becomes available, "New Version Pre-download" appears below the "Start" button on the launcher interface. Select this option to pre-download the resources.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  ✦Android/iOS: When pre-download for the latest version becomes available, press the "Pre-download" button, either on the title screen after a successful login or on the in-game Terminal page, and confirm to pre-download the resources.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You can continue playing the game while the pre-downloading process is ongoing on your mobile device or the PC launcher. The process can be paused at any time. Whether it is complete or not, the update maintenance will speed up to a certain degree when initiated.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Please ensure that you have a stable network connection during the pre-downloading process.
