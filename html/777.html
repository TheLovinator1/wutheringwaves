  7. About the performance issues:
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 We are aware of a series of performance issues our players have experienced (e.g. lags, freezes, frame rate drops, device overheating, blurry graphics, crashes, or force quits) and we are working to identify the causes and address these issues.
</p>
<p>
 In addition, we have included fixes to some of the most urgent issues with the broadest impact (e.g. login failures or overheating) in an emergency patch to ensure the stability of the game for most players. However, if you continue to experience serious overheating or frequent crashes in the current version, please consider checking your device load status via [Settings] - [Graphics] and lower the graphics settings in the case of an overload for a smoother gaming experience.
</p>
<p>
 Lastly, our team would like to thank all players again for your support and understanding.
</p>
<p>
 Please rest assured that we are dedicated to providing the best possible experience for our players, and we take performance concerns seriously. In future updates, we will continue to optimize the game's performance to improve your gaming experience. Please stay tuned to our upcoming notices and announcements.
