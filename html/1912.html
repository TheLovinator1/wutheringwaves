 Version 2.0 Preview
</h1>
<h1>
 New Region
</h1>
<p>
 Rinascita
</p>
<p>
 Ragunna, in southern Rinascita, holds the closest bond with their Sentinel Imperator among the nation's many city-states. Most Ragunnesi worship the Sentinel, viewing Common Echoes as divine blessings. Ragunna is also home to the Order of the Deep, widely regarded as the Sentinel's earthly emissaries.
</p>
<p>
 The Black Shores report that the Threnodian in Ragunna remains dormant. In recent years, however, even Sentinel Imperator has fallen silent, no longer speaking directly to the Ragunnesi...

<p>
 The second daughter of Montelli and an art investor unbound by convention, Carlotta moves seamlessly through social circles and business transactions while quietly handling the family's unspeakable "troubles" in secret.

</h1>
<p>
 5-Star Weapon: The Last Dance (Pistols)
</p>

 4-Star Weapon: Call of the Abyss (Rectifier)
</p>
<p>
 Held by the keepers of this land, this scepter was once a symbol of dominion over its people and the architectural marvels they achieved. However, it has long lost its luster, and its grandeur blends into the ripples of the pipe organ melodies of Rinascita.
