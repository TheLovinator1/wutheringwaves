 Dear Rover,
</p>
<p>
 To provide a better gaming experience for all Rovers, we will begin a grayscale test of the pre-download feature for the official launcher in version 1.2.
</p>
<p>
 Once pre-download is available, Rovers participating in the grayscale test can use this feature to download version 1.2 update package in advance.
</p>
<p>
 With pre-download, Rovers can experience the new version more quickly after the maintenance.
</p>
<p>
 To ensure stability and compatibility, a group of Rovers using the official PC client will be randomly chosen to join the grayscale test. The pre-download feature will be available to all Rovers through the official launcher in future updates. Please stay tuned to our official announcements for more details.
