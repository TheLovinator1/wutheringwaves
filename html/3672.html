 <em>
  In Tactical Simulacra: Off Tune, some of your attacks build up certain enemies' Off-Tune Level. Once their Off-Tune Level reaches the limit, they enter the Mistune state. During this state, you can unleash a powerful Tune Break to shatter their defenses. Landing a Tune Break resets the enemies' Off-Tune Level and inflicts Tune Disruption, leaving them vulnerable to follow-up attacks.
