  [PC Launcher Update Notice]
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 To provide a better gaming experience for all Rovers, we released the 1.6.2 launcher update on 2024-09-20 (UTC+8), introducing the following new features:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   Pre-download feature for the PC launcher
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   With the pre-download feature enabled, New Version Pre-download appears below the Start button on the Launcher 1.6.2 interface. Select this option to pre-download the material for the latest version.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   You can pause the pre-downloading process at any time. Whether the process is complete or not, the update maintenance will speed up to a certain degree when initiated.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <em>
  The pre-download material is approximately 30GB in size. Make sure that you have enough storage space on your PC.
 </em>
</p>
<ol start="2">
 <li>
  <p>
   Default use of DirectX 12 to launch the game (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 Series and above, Intel graphics cards)
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   With DirectX 12, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards will support DLSS 3 super resolution and NVIDIA Reflex, while XeSS upscaling will be enabled for Intel graphics cards. This update will also improve compatibility across a wide range of GPUs, resolving issues such as black screens or visual distortions caused by certain hardware.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   After the update, shaders will need to be recompiled the first time you launch the game with DirectX 12. This process may cause some initial stuttering or frame rate drops, but performance will return to normal once it's complete.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 <em>
  If shader compilation causes extended stuttering or disrupts gameplay, you can exit the game and select Launch with DirectX 11 below the Start button, or contact customer service for assistance.
 </em>
