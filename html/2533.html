 Convene Rules
</h1>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   This is an Anniversary Resonator Convene event banner. Use Radiant Tide to convene. You are guaranteed at least one 4-Star or higher rarity Resonator or Weapon every 10 attempts.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The Guarantee count is shared among all [Anniversary Resonator Convene] and [Featured Resonator Convene] event banners. If a 5-Star Resonator is not obtained in this event banner, the Guarantee count is carried over across other [Anniversary Resonator Convene] and [Featured Resonator Convene] event banners and resets once a 5-Star Resonator is obtained.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   You can select one 5-Star Resonator within a designated range as the Featured Resonator of the event banner (you can re-select at any time). Every time a 5-Star Resonator is obtained, there is a 50.00000% chance it will be the Featured 5-Star Resonator of this event banner, and a 50.00000% chance it will be a random non-Featured 5-Star Resonator (not including the selectable Resonators for this event banner). All 5-Star non-Featured Resonators have equal drop rate. If the 5-Star Resonator obtained is not the Featured Resonator, the next 5-Star Resonator is guaranteed to be the Featured Resonator.
  </p>

  <p>
   Selectable 5-Star Resonators: Jiyan, Yinlin, Zhezhi, Xiangli Yao, Phoebe
