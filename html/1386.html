 Dear Rovers,
</p>
<p>
 Thank you for your continued support and enthusiasm for Wuthering Waves!

 With version 1.2 "In the Turquoise Moonglow" drawing to a close, how have you been faring with the "Converging Paths" event? Did you enjoy the Moonlit Fair?
</p>
<p>
 Since the "Converging Paths" event's release, we have received your complaints about the sudden increase in resource requirements after unlocking Resonator Xiangli Yao and its added strain. To help ease your burden, we've decided to roll out a batch of special leveling events in Version 1.3 in addition to the content we originally planned:

 Alongside the events already announced, we'll add three leveling events—two brand-new and one rerun. Participate in these events to get a wealth of Shell Credit and various development materials. Don't miss out if you are at Union Level 14 or above!
