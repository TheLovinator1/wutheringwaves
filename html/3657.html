<p>
 "Just an ordinary student."

  5-Star Weapon: Kumokiri (Broadblade)
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 A crimson thread emerges in the void, as if binding the structures of all things onto a single thread.

 At her fingertips, the endless season is drawn taut, snipped, and rewoven, until the scattered path at last converges once more upon this timeline.

<h1>
 Features
</h1>
<p>
 **
</p>
<h2>
 Negative Statuses**
</h2>
<p>
 <strong>
  Adjusted the effects of Havoc Bane, Fusion Burst, Glacio Chafe, and Electro Flare.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  [Havoc Bane]
 </strong>
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   Some Havoc attacks will apply a stackable Havoc Bane effect to the target.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   While Havoc Bane lasts, the DEF of the inflicted target is reduced. Havoc Bane stacks up to 3 times by default, with each stack reducing the target's DEF by 2%.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 <strong>
  [Fusion Burst]
 </strong>
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   Some Fusion attacks will apply a stackable Fusion Burst effect to the target.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When Fusion Burst is stacked to its max, all stacks will be removed to trigger an explosion, dealing Fusion DMG around the target. Fusion Burst effect stacks up to 10 times by default. The higher the stacks, the more DMG dealt.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 <strong>
  [Glacio Chafe]
 </strong>
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   Some Glacio attacks will apply a stackable Glacio Chafe effect to the target.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When Glacio Chafe is inflicted, the target receives Glacio DMG. Glacio Chafe stacks up to 10 times by default. The higher the stacks, the more DMG dealt. Each stack of Glacio Chafe effect reduces the target's Movement Speed.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   When Glacio Chafe reaches max stacks, the target will be frozen, and all stacks of Glacio Chafe will be removed. Struggle to accelerate your recovery from the frozen state.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 <strong>
  [Electro Flare]
 </strong>
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   Some Electro attacks will apply a stackable Electro Flare effect to the target.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   While Electro Flare lasts, it deals periodic Electro DMG to the target. The target loses half of the effect stacks with each instance of damage. Electro Flare stacks up to 10 times by default. The higher the stacks, the more DMG dealt.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   At maximum stacks of Electro Flare, any new stack inflicted becomes stackable Electro Rage. Electro Rage increases the DMG dealt by the next Electro Flare trigger. Electro Rage is removed once triggered. Electro Rage stacks up to 10 times by default. The higher the stacks, the more DMG Electro Flare deals.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 **
</p>
<h2>
 Echo Recommendation**
</h2>
<p>
 <strong>
  Added a "Main Echo" slot

  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The top three most-equipped Main Echoes will be displayed along with their respective percentages.
  </p>
 </li>

  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 **
</p>
<h2>
 One-click Absorption of Echoes**
</h2>
<p>
 <strong>
  Adjusted Echo absorption

  <p>
   Wider absorption radius inside a Nightmare Nest than in the Overworld.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   Added the "Auto Supplement" feature to the Resonator Ascension, Weapon Ascension, and Skill Upgrade menus. If you already have all the required upgrade materials, you can proceed with the Ascension/Upgrade process as usual. If the required upgrade materials are insufficient, clicking the "Auto Supplement" button will open the Auto Supplement screen.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Through the Auto Supplement screen, you can see what materials you have and how many more you need, and use Synthesis, Conversion, or Supply Packs to obtain the rest of the required materials.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   During Purification, if low-rarity materials are insufficient, the system will begin searching for lower-rarity materials and Supply Packs to auto-fill the required material list until all requirements are met.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   If Synthesis, Conversion, and Supply Packs still cannot provide enough materials, a shortcut button will appear to direct you to where you can acquire more.
