   [Between Light and Shadow] is a Featured Resonator Convene event banner. Use Radiant Tide to convene. You are guaranteed at least one 4-Star or higher rarity Resonator or Weapon every 10 attempts.

  <p>
   The Guarantee count is shared among all [Anniversary Resonator Convene] and [Featured Resonator Convene] event banners. If a 5-Star Resonator is not obtained in this event banner, the Guarantee count is carried over across other [Anniversary Resonator Convene] and [Featured Resonator Convene] event banners and resets once a 5-Star Resonator is obtained.

   Featured Resonator Zani is exclusive to the [Between Light and Shadow] Featured Resonator Convene and will not be available by other means once the event ends.
