 Dear Rovers,
</p>
<p>
 Due to design errors, certain merchandise items (including Yinlin Acrylic Stand, Yinlin Clear Card, and Yinlin Ticket-style Card) will not be available during the Animate x Wuthering Waves pop-up event as originally planned. The re-design process for these items is currently underway to align with the initial plan. All collaboration merchandise, including the above 3 items, will be made available for online purchase after the event. Further details will be announced at a later date.
