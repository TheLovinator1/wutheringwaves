        <title>Wuthering Waves Developer&#39;s Message Vol. 4: Version 1.2 Optimization Preview With A Special Note From Developers</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/1109" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Dear Rover:  
  
Wuthering Waves Version 1.2 &#34;In the Turquoise Moonglow&#34; is on the horizon. Here&#39;s a sneak peek at the upcoming improvements and a special note from the dev team.

**✦ Version 1.2 Optimization Preview ✦**

**1. New Custom Lock-On Feature**  
  
In Version 1.1, we implemented several quality-of-life improvements to the auto lock-on system, including optimizations for Resonators and some Echo skills. With the release of Version 1.2, you&#39;ll gain access to the new Custom Lock-On feature under Settings - Control. This option allows you to set the auto lock-on priorities for enemies based on your combat preferences.

**2. New Utility Hoverdroid: Shooter**  
  
We&#39;ve heard your feedback regarding the need to frequently switch between teams when there are no pistol-using Resonators available for challenges like the Photonvault and similar puzzles. In Version 1.2, you&#39;ll be able to use the new Hoverdroid: Shooter Utility.  
  
Once the Utilities feature is available, you can equip the Hoverdroid: Shooter in the Utility Wheel. To shoot with the Hoverdroid, simply tap or hold the Basic Attack button.  
  
More Hoverdroid features are under development. We hope this new addition will help your better explore Solaris.

**3. New Feature to Store Excess Waveplate**  
  
A new feature to store excess Waveplates will be introduced in Version 1.2. Once you reach the Waveplate cap, you will receive Waveplate Crystals instead. These Crystals can be exchanged for Waveplates of equivalent value.  
  
※ You will regenerate 1 Waveplate Crystal every 12 minutes, up to 480 Waveplate Crystals. Once this limit is reached, you will not gain additional Waveplate Crystals.

**4. New Resonator Showcase Feature**  
  
With the release of Version 1.2, you can view and display the Convene scenes of unlocked Resonators with the Resonator Showcase feature.  
  
※ Tap the avatar on the Terminal screen to open the Resonator Showcase. You can display up to 3 selected Resonators here.

**5. Option to Play at 120 FPS**  
  
The 120 FPS option will be available on select PC devices in Version 1.2. Stay tuned for our official announcements for more availability details.  
  
  
**6. New [Depths of Illusive Realm] Store Rewards**  
  
Thank you for your love and support for Depths of Illusive Realm. As we approach the final stages of Version 1.1&#39;s Dreams Ablaze in Darkness event, the White Cat will bring new exchange items to the Illusive Store.  
  
To help you try out and level up more Resonators, we will add more exchange items to the Illusive Store in subsequent versions of the Depths of Illusive Realm event. These items will be available as the Convene events for the second half of each version are released.  
  
You will receive a system mail reminder after the exchange items are added. Please remember to exchange the rewards after fully exploring Depths of Illusive Realm.  
  
  
**7. More Guidebook Activity Points from a Daily Quest**  
  
With the release of Version 1.2, the Activity Points reward for the &#34;Spend 180 Waveplates&#34; daily quest will be increased from +20 to +60. We hope this change will help you complete your daily Activity Points quests more quickly.

**✦ A Special Note from Developers✦**

Version 1.2 &#34;In the Turquoise Moonglow&#34; is coming soon. In this update, we&#39;ll introduce the Moon-Chasing Festival event and dedicate ourselves to address any issues that have impacted your experience so far.  
  
We&#39;re well aware that many aspects of Wuthering Waves still have room for improvement, and we&#39;re committed to listening to your feedback to continually optimize and enhance the game. Together, we aim to create a better Solaris-3 and offer you more thrilling adventures.  
  
We are also excited to announce that everyone will receive the 5-Star Resonator Xiangli Yao for free during the second half of Version 1.2. Stay tuned for more detailed event information!

We sincerely hope to join you on your adventures and look forward to your progress and growth in Wuthering Waves. Thank you again for your dedication and support!</content>

        <title>Wuthering Waves Developer&#39;s Message: The Black Shores Preview</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/1240" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Dear Rovers,  
  
First, we want to express our heartfelt thanks for all your support and love for Wuthering Waves. It&#39;s crazy how time flies—we are already halfway through Version 1.2 &#34;In the Turquoise Moonglow&#34;. We hope the Moonlit Fair has been a blast for you so far.  
  
While you are enjoying all the festivities, new stories are unfolding beyond the borders of Jinzhou. We have some awesome updates in the pipeline and we are excited to give you a sneak peek through this preview.  
  
In this preview, you can have a glimpse into the new area, gameplay features, and some storylines currently in development.  
  
  
**✦New Area✦**  
  
  
  
**New Area: The Black Shores**  
  
The Black Shores, an archipelago enshrouded in mysteries and turmoil, remains sealed away from the world in thick digital fog. It is still uncertain when or who will lift its veil, allowing it to once more shoulder the task of connecting the world.  
  
  
**✦New Character✦**  
  
  
  
**New Resonator: Youhu**  
  
We&#39;ve cooked up something special with our upcoming Resonator Youhu. Her Resonance Skill and Resonance Liberation come with new QTE mechanics that bring a twist to combat. It&#39;s fun, it&#39;s unique, and we think you&#39;re going to love it.  
  
  
**✦New Gameplay Content✦**  
  
  
  
**New &#34;Portal&#34; Puzzles**  
  
We are adding &#34;Portals&#34; to some puzzle-solving scenarios so you can hop between different areas, or even... No more spoilers, we can&#39;t wait to see how you use them!  
  
  
  
  
**New Special Enemy: Hedgepuff**  
  
Complete the new collection quests in the Black Shores to unlock this little guy and other special enemies. Keep an eye out for them—they are scattered across the shores, waiting for Rovers brave enough to test their skills.

### ✦How to Participate✦

In order to successfully complete the V1.2 WUWA Discord Quest, players who meet the eligibility criteria must live stream their Wuthering Waves gameplay to a friend via a Discord voice channel for a minimum duration of 15 minutes on the desktop app.

3. Once there, start a voice call or join a voice channel and select the Screen Share icon located in the voice status panel. Be sure to select the individual application for the game before you Go Live.

\*NOTE: You must select the game application to stream! Streaming your device’s screen will not progress your Quest forward. Once you stream, you can check the progress bar on the Quest Home to ensure progress is being made on the Quest.

4. When you’re ready to stream your gameplay, press Go Live. You can learn more about streaming your game [here](&lt;https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151-Go-Live-and-Screen-Share#h_01HFFJ28PJAY9AHGRQ85XRSF8G&gt;).

### 

### ✦Redemption Instructions✦

### ✦Discord Quest FAQ✦

**Q: Is there a limit on how many Quests I can redeem on my Discord account?**

A: Eligible users can redeem one of each of the available Quest campaigns on their Discord account.

For more information on Discord Quests, visit [Discord Quest Help Center](&lt;https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/22225719947543&gt;).

**Q: Is this feature/promotion available in my region?**

A: Some Quests will not be available in all regions based on terms and conditions. If you are in an ineligible region for a Quest, you will not be able to complete it.

Additionally, Discord’s premium services are restricted in some regions. If you are unable to access the Gift Inventory, you are not eligible for Quests.

**Q: I have concerns or questions regarding privacy and Quests.**

A: We encourage you to review [Discord’s Privacy Policy](&lt;https://discord.com/privacy&gt;) for further details about how we use your information. You can head over to [Data Used for In-Game Rewards](&lt;https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/22225542459415&gt;) article, to learn more about how we use data for Quests.

**Q: Why am I unable to complete Quest while using Linux?**

A: Currently, Quest rewards are unable to be earned on Linux devices.

However, Discord team is looking into a resolution for this issue so that earning Quest rewards is possible on Linux in the future. For now, we recommend completing the requirement on a different operating system, like Windows or MacOS.

Discord support team does not have an exact ETA for when a solution will be available, and won&#39;t be able to provide any status updates on this specific issue.

**Q: I no longer see a Quest. Where did it go?**

A: Quests are typically only available for a limited amount of time. If you no longer see a Quest in the Quest Home or in-app notifications about the quest, the period to complete and claim the reward for the Quest is over.</content>

        <title>Updates for PC Launcher 1.6.2</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/1320" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">To provide a better experience for all Rovers, we will be releasing the 1.6.2 launcher update on September 20 (UTC+8), introducing the following new features:  
  
  
**1. Pre-download feature for the PC launcher**  
  
**2. Default use of DirectX 12 to launch the game****(NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 Series and above, Intel graphics cards)**  
  
① With DirectX 12, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards will support DLSS 3 super resolution and NVIDIA Reflex, while XeSS upscaling will be enabled for Intel graphics cards. This update will also improve compatibility across a wide range of GPUs, resolving issues such as black screens or visual distortions caused by certain hardware.  
  
② After the update, shaders will need to be recompiled the first time you launch the game with DirectX 12. This process may cause some initial stuttering or frame rate drops, but performance will return to normal once it&#39;s complete.  
  
  
**※If shader compilation causes extended stuttering or disrupts gameplay, you can exit the game and select &#34;Launch with DirectX 11&#34; under the &#34;Start&#34; button, or contact customer service for assistance.**</content>

**[PC Launcher Update Notice]**  
  
To provide a better gaming experience for all Rovers, we released the 1.6.2 launcher update on 2024-09-20 (UTC+8), introducing the following new features:  
  
1. Pre-download feature for the PC launcher  
  
① With the pre-download feature enabled, New Version Pre-download appears below the Start button on the Launcher 1.6.2 interface. Select this option to pre-download the material for the latest version.  
  
② You can pause the pre-downloading process at any time. Whether the process is complete or not, the update maintenance will speed up to a certain degree when initiated.  
  
※ The pre-download material is approximately 30GB in size. Make sure that you have enough storage space on your PC.  
  
2. Default use of DirectX 12 to launch the game (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 Series and above, Intel graphics cards)  
  
① With DirectX 12, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards will support DLSS 3 super resolution and NVIDIA Reflex, while XeSS upscaling will be enabled for Intel graphics cards. This update will also improve compatibility across a wide range of GPUs, resolving issues such as black screens or visual distortions caused by certain hardware.  
  
② After the update, shaders will need to be recompiled the first time you launch the game with DirectX 12. This process may cause some initial stuttering or frame rate drops, but performance will return to normal once it&#39;s complete.  
  
※ If shader compilation causes extended stuttering or disrupts gameplay, you can exit the game and select Launch with DirectX 11 below the Start button, or contact customer service for assistance.

        <content type="text">Dear Rovers,

Since the start of Version 1.1 CBT, our work has been overshadowed by unauthorized content leaks. These leaks have spread fast and wide, including story cutscenes, storyboard drafts, character concept art, and even discarded environment assets. Many of you have expressed frustration at encountering leaked content despite your efforts to avoid it, largely due to platform algorithms. These unverified leaks have dulled the impact of our official version updates and caused major spoilers, undermining the experience we&#39;ve carefully crafted for you.

Last month, we issued a statement condemning leaks and received widespread support from our community. Thanks to this, many leakers realized the harm they were causing and ceased their activities. Unfortunately, with the launch of the Version 1.4 CBT server, we are once again facing severe leaks of unreleased content.

Developing a new version is meticulous and time-consuming. Character creation, for example, begins several versions ahead with user research, followed by months of design, development, testing, and fine-tuning. Before each update, we conduct a closed beta test to ensure the final product meets player expectations. Promotion only begins when everything is ready, with methodically scheduled moments to provide the best experience. We believe this approach ensures consistent, polished releases, allowing players and content creators to fully engage with each update. Unfortunately, leaks disrupt this process, taking away the element of surprise and undermining the hard work of our team members who put their hearts into every detail.

In response to the damage caused by these leaks, we have implemented stronger measures to prevent future incidents. These measures include reinforcing confidentiality in our test servers, issuing formal warnings, and collaborating with various content-sharing platforms to remove unauthorized material. Additionally, we have initiated legal proceedings against severe breaches of intellectual property, which are currently progressing through the courts. We are committed to defending our work against unauthorized distribution and are prepared to take further legal actions as needed.

Now, with Version 1.4 CBT on track and preparations for official marketing well underway, the team is focused on developing our next major update—a brand-new area that we&#39;ve been designing based on all the feedback from you since launch. This new area is a true co-creation between us and the player community; in a way, it belongs to all of us. We call on all players to cherish this creative journey together. Please help us protect our hard work by standing against leaks. We will continue gathering evidence against those who steal and distribute our unreleased materials. If you encounter any leaks, we encourage you to report them to us via our dedicated email: [legal@kurogames.com](&lt;mailto:legal@kurogames.com&gt;).

Once again, we extend our deepest thanks to all of you for your love and support.

        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/1567" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Dear Rovers,  
Thank you for your continued support for Wuthering Waves. With Version 1.4: When the Night Knocks just around the corner, it&#39;s time for another installment of Wuthering Waves Developer&#39;s Message. In this update, we&#39;re adding new gameplay elements, an exciting new feature, and optimizations to enhance your experience.  
  
**✦New Gameplay Elements✦**

**New Combat Mechanism: Dream Link**  
Dream Link is a new combat mechanism that will be introduced in the Main Event of Version 1.4. Dream Link enhances the synergy between your Resonators, allowing them to unlock their true potential together. When certain conditions align during combat, Dream Link will activate, dramatically amplifying your team’s combat prowess.

**Overdrive Combat: Illusive Sprint**  
In the Main Event of Version 1.4, you can pick up the white cat&#39;s blessings to enter the Illusive Sprint state that increases your moving speed. Lumi, a Resonator who will make her debut in the new version, has a similar ability. When certain requirements are met, instead of dodging, Lumi dashes to get out of harm&#39;s way and is capable of attacking enemies while moving at high speed.

These two new gameplay mechanisms will be available in the Main Event of Version 1.4. Once the Main Event concludes, it will be added as a Permanent Event, where the same gameplay mechanisms will still be available.  
  
**✦New Feature✦**  
**Weapon Cosmetics: Weapon Projection**  
With Version 1.4, we’re introducing an exciting new customization feature: Weapon Projections. This feature lets you transform the appearance of your weapons without affecting their stats, allowing you to create a look that’s entirely your own.   
※ Participate in the Main Event of Version 1.4 to obtain a free Weapon Projection associated with the event featured 4-Star Sword.  
Additionally, we are adding Transparent Weapon Projections, available for all five weapon types. You can use a Transparent Weapon Projection to turn the equipped weapon completely or partially invisible. We hope these new options let you add even more personality to your Resonators’ looks, whether you&#39;re exploring or capturing moments in photos.  
※ Participate in Version 1.4&#39;s Depths of Illusive Realm to obtain a complete set of Transparent Weapon Projections for free.  
※ Equip a Transparent Weapon Projection to make Rectifiers and Gauntlets completely invisible, or turn Swords, Broadblades, or Pistols partially transparent.

**✦Gaming Experience Optimizations✦**

**Leveling-related Optimizations: Double Rewards, Step-by-Step Echo Upgrade**  
To enhance your long-term gaming experience, Version 1.4 will introduce a series of leveling-related optimizations as part of an ongoing project. In this update, you’ll be able to Fast Travel directly to the location of any Tacet Suppression or Boss challenge via the Map.  
Additionally, you’ll have the option to spend double the Waveplates to earn double rewards upon completing a Forgery, Simulation, or Tacet Suppression challenge. We&#39;ve also improved the display of Results Screens, giving you a clearer view of the rewards you&#39;ve earned.

Last but not least, in Version 1.4, you can conveniently upgrade an Echo to the exact levels that unlock new substats (5/10/15/20/25) through the Auto-Select Settings. We hope this change can improve your Echo Upgrade experience and efficiency.

**Interface-related Optimizations: Waveplate Info Pop-up, Echo Info Pop-up, Tower of Adversity Interface Adjustments**  
Starting from Version 1.4, whenever you log into the game, you&#39;ll receive a pop-up displaying the amount of Waveplates and Waveplate Crystals you own.  
The displayed information for a newly absorbed Echo will also be optimized. Upon absorption, the Echo&#39;s Sonata Effect category will be displayed along with its Mainstat and Substat.  
In the current version, adjusting your team lineup in the Tower of Adversity requires leaving and re-entering, which we know can interrupt your gameplay experience. To improve this, we&#39;ve optimized the interface in the upcoming version, allowing you to view and adjust your team directly within the Tower.  
Apart from the above, more optimizations are in the pipeline, along with more gameplay elements and features. Please stay tuned!

        <title>Developer&#39;s Notes - Resonators of First Encounter</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/162" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Many ideas and interpretations came across our minds when designing the characters within the world of Wuthering Waves. Rovers must also be eager to learn more about the trio of Resonators who they would initially meet at the very start of their journey. So, we hope to share our notes, to help Rovers understand more about them. 

**Yangyang**

**1.1 Like wind flowing at your side**  
  
  
The first character for the Rover to know in the world of Wuthering Waves, Yangyang will be the starting member on your team as you set on the journey. She plays key parts in upcoming stories, as well.   
Utmost gentleness is going to be the impression of Yangyang in her long companionship going forward.

Even in this land of pain and destruction, there are still ones keeping their maximal kindness &#34;naively&#34;, of whom Yangyang is an embodiment. She endeavors to find the perfect solution out of the impossible; She dedicates herself to the defense of all the goodness, even sometimes at the cost of herself.  
Being gentle never means ever-surrendering tolerance; on the contrary, it brings great power. That warrants a natural depth and a contradiction to Yangyang&#39;s personality: she must be tough and even obstinate to be a practicer of kindness.  
Of course, this comes at an expense. On the journey, Yangyang might face crises and loss due to her character.  
  
  
**1.2 The Skylark that praises beauty**  
  
  
The images of Wind and Feather. They leave the impression of light and soft. Under some conditions, however, they may show unexpected strength.  
These two images come close to Yangyang&#39;s way of being gentle: a soothing, innocent girl in ordinary times, but a warrior like howling winds during fights.  
This extends our imagination and reminds us of Percy Shelley&#39;s To a Skylark: &#34;Languor cannot be ... Thou lovest, but ne&#39;er knew love&#39;s sad satiety&#34;.

Skylark is not a peculiar kind of bird like Fenghuang or eagle, but it is an idealization, a praise for beauty and happiness.  
May Yangyang bring solace to you just like a skylark, in this world of surging tides of sounds.  
  
  
**1.3 Gentleness: Key to Yangyang&#39;s Image**  
  
  
Gentleness might be one of the classic tags of a character that is most common but most difficult to define, especially for Yangyang, as she is not &#34;weak&#34; in the way people would generally tell of a gentle character.  
With that in mind, when Yangyang was being put into shape, we hoped she could shine more different lights to catch your attention, except from the above-mentioned images of skylark and feather.  
For example, a sense of first love. Yangyang&#39;s general impression is warming, just like your childhood sweetheart, who has been here so long, that you will always recall the first sight of her, no matter how far you have gone, or how many faces you have met.  
Another role she plays is a listener who senses the breezes. Yangyang is not someone of strong mood swings; instead, she listens quietly, and feels closely. She connects to the wind, in her way.  
Hence, a girl soothing like the wind and yet strong in her senses, came to Rover&#39;s side.

---

**Chixia**  
  
  
  
**2.1 Chixia Is Gonna Light Up Your World!**  
  
  
In an overall depressing world, there is a passionate and candid companion, unfearful of letting her emotions be heard, accompanying Rover carrying out more and more exciting adventures going forward.  
By featuring eye-catching bright red colors in her appearance, along with a backward-tied sprout, all of which manifests the passionate and high-spirited characteristics of Chixia.

Chixia&#39;s outfit bears a rather bold style similar to collage and cut-out arts. During battles, parts of her outfit flutters with the wind as she performs actions, further highlighting the superb pistol-wielding skills of Tiancheng&#39;s favorite hero.

Chixia features various distinctive personal traits, such as fondness towards spices, and cherishing of the macram bracelets she wears from her home, etc. These reflect her status of being a migrant to Tiancheng, which in turn draws out a detailed and complete worldview of Huanglong.

**2.2 Chixia? Or Ma Xiaofang?**  
  
  
Throughout the history of Huanglong, many migrants from various regions of the nation moved to Tiancheng. The Ma family was one of the many.  
As Xiaofang pursues her hero dream, she always wanted a renowned nickname of her own, just like those from the plays, to boost confidence when in need. Hence the nickname &#34;Chixia&#34;, Blazing Dawn.  
But of course, besides these &#34;glorified excuses&#34;, the real reason behind the nickname contains notions of Xiaofang&#39;s own personal motives. Which is something that is left for Rover to discover.  
  
  
**2.3 Chixia&#39;s Hero Dream**

Having witnessed her own courageous father fighting for his nation, the regular visit to hero-themed plays during her childhood, and even the valiant atmosphere among the Tiancheng population resisting the Wuthering Waves, all played a part in the illumination of Chixia&#39;s passion for heroism.  
A hero can be many forms, whether it be a distinguished warrior possessing the might to turn the tides of battle, or an unsung servant who gives in silence yet asks for nothing in return.  
For Chixia, the word &#34;hero&#34; means someone who can face their fears head on, someone that&#39;s able to safeguard those in need during critical times. No matter family, friends, or any other person requiring assistance, Chixia is always the first to step forward.  
By exploring a variety of directions, Chixia ultimately chose to pursue this path in mind. She is a vibrant figure for the entire Tiancheng to view.

---

**Bailian**  
  
  
**3.1 A Cold Archaeologist**

As one of the three companions Rover would meet early on in the journey, Bailian is a rather cold and reserved person when compared to the gentleness of Yangyang and the enthusiastic Chixia.  
Not only a &#34;Cold Beauty&#34; who distances herself from others, as an archaeologist of the Huanglong Academy, Bailian&#39;s personality also bears the rationality that of a scientist.

Thus, due to having extreme rationale, Bailian features some peculiar traits. One of which is showing meticulous attention to details, not being able to stand descriptions such as &#34;a touch of oil&#34; within cooking recipes, and instead she will precisely measure the amount of ingredients needed using a proper scale...  
  
  
**3.2 The Birth of You&#39;tan**

You&#39;tan is a Remnant symbiotically connected with Bailian. It obeys Bailian&#39;s commands, and is able to reflect her physical condition to a certain degree.  
Bailian was once left in a life-threatening situation, one which downright demolished her trust of other human beings, leading to You&#39;tan&#39;s birth in the process. In Bailian&#39;s own words, You&#39;tan is &#34;a copy of myself&#34;.  
Rather to have trust in others, Bailian is more willing to trust You&#39;tan. You&#39;tan also seems to possess powers of inversion, embodying Bailian&#39;s kindness and will within itself.  
  
  
**3.3 Diving Into Bailian and You&#39;tan&#39;s Appearances**

Similar to her name &#34;Bailian&#34;, White Lotus, Bailian&#39;s appearance shows hints of her cold personality. Her clothing style features simple yet elegant black &amp; white coloring.  
On the other hand, Bailian is a lady of action who would more than often explore archaeological sites personally. Therefore, her outfit is rather close-fitting and function orientated, at the same time not lacking in Huanglong characteristics in its detailing.

You&#39;tan presents an airy and streamlined overall appearance, showing matching elegance to that of Bailian. The many mysterious petal-like patterns that surround its body can also be seen as an echo to its master&#39;s name.

The entirety of You&#39;tan‘s tail section is hollow, which extends a sound spectrum acting as the connection with Bailian. You&#39;tan&#39;s personalities can also be examined during combats and interactions with Bailian.

Three Resonators, three distinct personalities. Even more mysteries around them await Rovers. Encounter and discover them in person. Subsequently, we will continue to unravel the world for Rovers to perceive.</content>

**✦UI✦**

- Added text corresponding to the Outro Skill icon on the Resonators - Forte page.  
- Optimized the display of Results Screens that appear after challenges are completed, giving you a clearer view of the rewards you&#39;ve earned.

- Optimized the display of the RES stats of enemies in the Tower of Adversity, allowing you to view the multiple RES categories an enemy may possess.  
- Adjusted the rules under which red dots appear on the Resonators page.  
- Adjusted the order in which information is presented when the pull-down button for a Resonator&#39;s Skill is pressed on the Resonators - Forte page. Skill Detail differences between the current level and the next level now appear first.

- Optimized the Chat button on Mobile, allowing customization via &#34;Customize Keybinds.&#34;  
  
**✦Graphics &amp; Performance✦**

- Added a process that instructs you to choose an image quality setting when you are creating a character for the first time. This setting can be adjusted afterward via Settings.  
- Added the &#34;Auto FPS&#34; option to the Graphics settings on Mobile.

        <title>Developer&#39;s Notes - Crownless: The Primal&#39;s Desire</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/179" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">**The Primal&#39;s Desire**  
  
  
A high rank Tacet Discord which mimics the form and actions that of a knight engaged in a ceaseless crusade. Despite its fabricated appearance, the Crownless knows nothing of a knight&#39;s duty, nor does it possess any chivalry.  
  
It attempts to understand and learn the behavior of a human knight in ward of its overlord, yet fails to grasp the true meaning of guardianship the role entails, as the entity only mechanically wields its lance believing that this will make itself into a glorious knight.  
  
In the end, it merely became a sinister ghost of warfare, lingering amidst a prolonged void of struggle, trapped in the infinite cycle of conflict and death. Once the fighting ends, it finds everything meaningless.  
  
Unknowingly, the feathers of the Crownless&#39; wings have been converted into colors of pitch black.

\*Images featured in this article are for illustration purposes only. Actual depiction may vary in-game.  
  
Even the lance that once symbolized honor has undergone erosion and mutation, radiating an unsettling aura.

**The &#34;Knight&#39;s&#34; Death Struggle**  
  
  
The engagement with the knight includes three stages, each featuring distinct styles of attack and levels of danger. Its condition gradually changes while facing a formidable opponent like the Rover.  
  
  
**1. Attempting**  
  
During the initial stage, the knight can be seen making its entrance wearing a cloak and engaging in melee combat with fists and feet.  
  
  
While the various move sets are relatively slow, such as long preparation and recovery stances before and after throwing a punch, they provide openings for counterattacks.  
  
  
Despite this, as seen from the knight&#39;s evasive maneuvers, it appears as though it is more in a state of enjoyment, giving the impression to be testing out Rover&#39;s capabilities in a provocative way.  
  
  
Yet the threat remains. Occasionally, the knight crouches, slamming its fist into the ground to emit a wide range of shockwave from the center. Although the move displays an obvious preparatory posture, a slight lapse of concentration may lead to receiving a serious blow due to its wide range of effect.  
  
  
Facing this first powerful foe after awakening can be a tense experience, requiring time to learn its patterns and perfect the timing of attacks and evasions. However, this stage allows Rovers to quickly regain their combat prowess.  
  
  
  
**2. Riled Up**  
  
The Crownless becomes fully riled up after these previous exchanges, having garnered interest in this capable adversary before it. Hence begins the second stage of the engagement.  
  
Compared to the previous stage, the knight will be more vigilant, always ready to strike or evade as though taking up the role of a professional boxer.  
  
  
Through endless wars and battles, it has forged itself into a proficient master of martial arts.  
  
As a war machine it no longer dawdles in movements, instead employing speed and precision to take down its target.  
  
Its actions become swifter, making attacks difficult to evade, especially with the added combos.  
  
  
By accumulating energy, the knight can release a devastating blow full of grandeur. However, this ability comes with a long recovery time, providing an ideal opportunity for the Rover to take advantage of.  
  
  
From this stage, it becomes apparent that the knight has incorporated various combat styles that of a human warrior into its own. Whether it be the stance of a boxer, or multiple forms of melee techniques, all shows the knight&#39;s ability to quickly learn and adapt to human behavior.  
  
  
**3. Fury**  
  
Having been torn by battle, the knight&#39;s cloak is now replaced by a pair of large feathered wings. A lance is called out from beneath its feet, as though showing it now has truly entered the role of a knight, ready to carry out a final duel with the Rover.  
  
With this transformation comes a complete change in the knight&#39;s fighting style. It shifts from pure melee attacks to menacing lance strikes, and the newly-obtained wings grant it the capability to pounce from the air.  
  
As the Rover faces sweeping lance blows, the initial strike is easily avoidable, but may be battered by the latter two that come in immediate succession. A combo of three sweeping attacks demands more accurate timing in evasion from its receiver.  
  
  
In addition to the lance, it would also fling sharp feathers at the unsuspecting Rover. A dishonorable move unlike that of a true knight, and rather more of a desperate attempt for victory out of fury.  
  
  
The knight&#39;s assaults from the air prove to be even more threatening than those on the ground. With greater flexibility in the direction of attacks, significantly increased range, and speed, they are extremely lethal.  
  
With the increase of frequency in lance sweeps supplemented by feather shots, the Rover becomes overwhelmed.  
  
  
  
Not only this, the jet black wings can also conjure up a column of tornado in place of the previous projectiles towards the Rover&#39;s way.  
  
  
  
After the grueling battle, the mock-up knight fades away under Rover&#39;s blade. The Crownless failed to acquire its &#34;crown&#34;.  
  
The crown represents a child&#39;s rite of passage into adulthood, and it is also the Crownless&#39; initial stage of imitating human beings. However, perhaps only when the Crownless truly understands the nature of human beings, can it find its own &#34;crown&#34; rather than merely imitate.  
  
This battle merely marks the beginning of the encounter between the Rover and the Crownless.</content>

        <title>FAQ – PlayStation®5</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/1858" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Dear Rovers,  
  
We are thrilled to announce that Wuthering Waves will officially launch on PlayStation®5 on January 2, 2025 (UTC+8). To help you seamlessly connect your PlayStation™Network (PSN) account with your Kuro Games account and sync your progress across platforms, we&#39;ve prepared this guide. Please take a moment to review it to ensure a smooth start to your adventure in Solaris-3.  
  
  
  
  
**Cross-Platform Progress Syncing**  
  
**Q:** Will my progress on different servers or platforms be shared under the same Kuro Games account after the PS5™ launch?  
  
**A:** Your progress will not be shared between different servers (e.g., Asia Server and Europe Server). However, within the same server, progress is synced across multiple platforms (PC, Android, iOS, and PS5™).  
  
  
  
  
If you start your journey on PS5™, you can later switch to PC or mobile platforms by logging in with the same Kuro Games account linked to your PSN account. Your progress will carry over seamlessly. Similarly, if you begin on PC or mobile, you can continue on PS5™ using the same Kuro Games account.  
  
  
  
  
**Q:** How can I sync my game progress between PS5™, PC, and mobile devices?  
  
**A:** To enable cross-platform game progress syncing, please link your PSN account to your Kuro Games account. Make sure that the region of your PSN account matches the server where your game character was created.  
  
Example 1: If the account character you wish to transfer progress from belongs to the North America server, you must use a PSN account from the America server to log in and bind it to a Kuro Account email to enable cross-platform progress synchronization.  
  
Example 2: If the account character you wish to transfer progress from belongs to the Asia server, you must use a PSN account from the Japan or Korea servers to log in and bind it to a Kuro Account email to enable cross-platform progress synchronization.  
  
※ Please note: If you are using a third-party login method such as Google or Facebook, you must first go to **Settings &gt; Account Settings &gt; User Center** in the game and complete the binding of a Kuro Account email to properly transfer your progress. Please note that verifying the registration email of the third-party login method (e.g., Google or Facebook) you used, without binding a Kuro Account email first, will not allow progress synchronization.

**Q:** Which servers are available for the PS5™ version of Wuthering Waves?  
  
**A:** The PS5™ version supports Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, America, and HMT (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) servers. However, the available server is determined by the region of your PSN account. For example:  
  
A PSN account registered in North America will access the America Server.  
  
A PSN account registered in Hong Kong will access the HMT Server.  
  
  
  
  
For more details on servers or to confirm your PSN account region, consult the table below or contact PlayStation Support.

**In-game Purchase**  
  
**Q:** Can I use items purchased on PC/Android/iOS platforms (Lunites, Lunite Subscription, etc.) on PlayStation® after linking the account?  
  
**A:** Yes, once your accounts are linked, any items purchased on one platform will be displayed and accessible on all other platforms.

**Q:** Why hasn&#39;t my purchase from the PlayStation™ Store/Web Store been delivered?  
  
**A:** Items purchased through the PlayStation™Store or Web Store will be processed for delivery after you log into the game. If you&#39;re experiencing issues with delivery, please try the following methods:  
  
Method 1: Restart the game and log in again to check if you&#39;ve received a delivery notification.  
  
Method 2: Check your inventory through &#34;Terminal&#34; &gt; &#34;Backpack&#34; to see if the purchased items are there.  
  
Method 3: Verify that the PSN account you&#39;re logged into is the same one used to make the purchase.  
  
If none of these methods resolve the issue, please contact customer support via &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Feedback&#34; in-game.

**Q:** If I create a new game character on PS5™, can I make purchases for this account on PC/mobile?  
  
**A:** Yes, you can make purchases for your account on PC, mobile, or the official website.  
  
  
  
  
**Q:** I purchased a PS5™ pre-order bundle. Which game character will receive the items?  
  
**A:** The pre-order bundle will be delivered to the game character of the Kuro Games account linked to your PS5™ when you first log into the game.  
  
Note: To ensure the correct delivery of your pre-order bundle, please make sure the region of your PSN account matches the region of your Kuro Games account.  
  
The pre-order bundle will be delivered immediately upon your first login.  
  
  
  
  
For information on how to link your Kuro Games account to the correct PSN account server, please refer to the &#34;Account Linking&#34; and &#34;Cross-Platform Progress Syncing&#34; sections.  
  
  
  
  
**Account Linking**  
  
**Q:** How do I link my PSN account to my Kuro Games account?  
  
**A:** You can choose one of the following two methods based on your situation:  
  
Method 1: If you&#39;ve previously created a Kuro Games account, it&#39;s recommended that you log in using your existing account. When you first enter Wuthering Waves on your PS5™, select &#34;Already have an account? Log in&#34; and follow the prompts to link your Kuro Games account with your current PSN account.  
  
Note: For added account security, it&#39;s recommended that you set a password for your Kuro Games account in &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Account Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;User Center.&#34;  
  
  
  
  
Method 2: If you don&#39;t have a Kuro Games account, you can create a new one using your current PSN account. When you first enter Wuthering Waves on your PS5™, select &#34;Create a Kuro Games account&#34; to log into the game.  
  
Note: If you choose this method, we recommend linking your email and setting a password in-game in &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Account Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;User Center&#34; so that you can later access the same account on other platforms.  
  
  
  
  
**Q:** I&#39;ve been playing Wuthering Waves on PC/mobile, and have already linked my PSN account to my Kuro Games account. But when I log into the game on PS5™, the progress is still not syncing. Why?  
  
**A:**  
  
**Situation 1:** The Kuro Games account linked to your PSN account is different from the one you used on PC/mobile.  
  
After logging in on PS5™, go to &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Account Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;User Center&#34; and check if the User ID linked to your PSN account matches the one you used on PC/mobile.  
  
If you need to use a different Kuro Games account to log into Wuthering Waves, you can try the following methods:  
  
Method 1: Create a PSN account with a region corresponding to your game character&#39;s server and follow the prompts after reopening the game.  
  
Method 2: Use the in-game &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Feedback&#34; to request account unlinking support.

※Please note: After unlinking your account, some PlayStation Store bundles with purchase limit of one may be affected. The in-game item you receive may change if you&#39;ve already exceeded the purchase limit on your Kuro Games account.  
  
Example: You previously bought [Awakening Bundle] on PSN account A linked to your Kuro Games account, and successfully received the bundle content in game.   
  
After linking your Kuro Games account to a new PSN account B and purchasing the same bundle again, you will not receive the same bundle items in game. Instead, you will receive [Lunites] equivalent to the bundle&#39;s value. Thank you for your understanding.  
  
  
  
**Situation 2:** The region of your PSN account doesn&#39;t match the server of your game character.  
  
Note: For information on how PSN account regions map to game servers, please refer to the &#34;Cross-Platform Progress Syncing&#34; section.  
  
If this is the case, try the following steps:

1. Ensure that your Kuro Games account is linked to an email. You can verify this in &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Account Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;User Center&#34; on PC/mobile.
2. Contact customer support for account unlinking support.
3. Create a new PSN account with a region corresponding to your game character&#39;s server.
4. Log in with the new PSN account and follow the prompts to link your Kuro Games account.

**Q:** How can I continue my progress from PS5™ on PC or mobile?  
  
**A:** To carry over your game progress from PS5™ to PC or mobile, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your Kuro Games account is protected by a password. You can do this in &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Account Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;User Center&#34; on PS5™.
2. When you open the game on PC or mobile, log in using the email linked to your PSN account and the password you set.

**Q:** How can I check which Kuro Games account is linked to my PSN account?  
  
**A:** After logging into the game, you can check the linked Kuro Games account in &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Account Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;User Center.&#34;  
  
  
  
  
**Q:** Can I unlink or change the Kuro Games account linked to my PSN account?  
  
**A:** Yes, you can request to unlink your PSN account through &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Feedback&#34; in-game. After unlinking, your game progress under your Kuro Games account will not be lost, but it will no longer be synced with your PSN account. Please note that you can only unlink one PSN account per Kuro Games account, so proceed with caution.  
  
Before unlinking, we recommend linking your email or setting a password via &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Account Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;User Center&#34; to avoid losing access to your Kuro Games account once your PSN account is unlinked.  
  
  
  
  
**Q:** Will I lose my game progress if I unlink my PSN account?  
  
**A:** No, your game progress will not be lost. Unlinking the PSN account only removes the data sharing between the two accounts. You will still be able to use your Kuro Games account on other platforms to access your game progress.  
  
  
  
  
**Q:** What if the game crashes before the linking window appears when I first log in on PS5™? Can I still link my accounts?  
  
**A:** Yes, you can restart the game and linking will still be available.  
  
  
  
  
**Q:** After linking my PSN account, can I log in on other platforms (e.g., PC, Android, iOS) using my PSN account, or use a different method to log in on PS5™?  
  
**A:** No, currently the PS5™ version of Wuthering Waves only supports logging in with a PSN account that is linked to a Kuro Games account. Other platforms do not support logging in with a PSN account.  
  
  
  
  
**Q:** Can I link multiple Kuro Games accounts to my PSN account? Or can my Kuro Games account be linked to multiple PSN accounts?  
  
**A:** No, each PSN account can only be linked to one Kuro Games account. Similarly, each Kuro Games account can only be linked to one PSN account.  
  
  
  
  
**Q:** How can I check which PSN account is currently linked?  
  
**A:** You can check the linked PSN account via &#34;Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;Account Settings&#34; &gt; &#34;User Center&#34; in-game.  
  
  
  
  
**Friends**  
  
**Q:** How many friend lists can I see in the PS5™ version of Wuthering Waves? What&#39;s the difference between them?  
  
**A:** On PS5™, you will see the following two friend lists:  
  
Game Friends: Displays the friends you&#39;ve added in the game, visible across all platforms.  
  
PlayStation™Network Friends: Shows your PSN friends who have played Wuthering Waves and are on the same server as you, as well as friends who haven&#39;t played Wuthering Waves. This list is only visible on PlayStation®5.  
  
  
  
  
**Q:** How can I see the User ID of a PlayStation™Network friend?  
  
**A:** You can only view the User ID of a PSN friend if both of you are logged into the PlayStation® platform.</content>

✦New Region✦  
Rinascita  
Ragunna, in southern Rinascita, holds the closest bond with their Sentinel Imperator among the nation&#39;s many city-states. Most Ragunnesi worship the Sentinel, viewing Common Echoes as divine blessings. Ragunna is also home to the Order of the Deep, widely regarded as the Sentinel&#39;s earthly emissaries.  
The Black Shores report that the Threnodian in Ragunna remains dormant. In recent years, however, even Sentinel Imperator has fallen silent, no longer speaking directly to the Ragunnesi...

4-Star Weapon: Call of the Abyss (Rectifier)

Discord Quest FAQ  
  
**Q: Is there a limit on how many Quests I can redeem on my Discord account?**  
  
A: Eligible users can redeem one of each of the available Quest campaigns on their Discord account.  
  
For more information on Discord Quests, visit our [Discord Quest Help Center](&lt;https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/22225719947543&gt;).  
  
**Q: Is this feature/promotion available in my region?**  
  
A: Some Quests will not be available in all regions based on terms and conditions. If you are in an ineligible region for a Quest, you will not be able to complete it.  
  
Additionally, Discord’s premium services are restricted in some regions. If you are unable to access the Gift Inventory, you are not eligible for Quests.  
  
**Q: I have concerns or questions regarding privacy and Quests.**   
  
A: We encourage you to review [Discord’s Privacy Policy](&lt;https://discord.com/privacy&gt;) for further details about how we use your information.

**Q: Why am I unable to complete Quest while using Linux?**  
  
A: Currently, Quest rewards are unable to be earned on Linux devices.  
  
However, Discord team is looking into a resolution for this issue so that earning Quest rewards is possible on Linux in the future. For now, we recommend completing the requirement on a different operating system, like Windows or MacOS.  
  
Discord support team does not have an exact ETA for when a solution will be available, and won&#39;t be able to provide any status updates on this specific issue.  
  
**Q: I no longer see a Quest. Where did it go?**  
  
A: Quests are typically only available for a limited amount of time. If you no longer see a Quest in the Quest Home or in-app notifications about the quest, the period to complete and claim the reward for the Quest is over.</content>

        <content type="text">Dear Rover,  
To bring you exciting new content and a better gaming experience, we will soon be conducting the update maintenance for Version 2.1: Waves Sing, and the Cerulean Bird Calls.  
During the maintenance, you will not be able to log in to the game. Please plan your time accordingly. Additionally, due to the large size of the update, we recommend updating the game while connected to a Wi-Fi network. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  
  
**[Maintenance Time &amp; Compensation Details]**  
**✦Maintenance Time: 2025-02-13 04:00 - 2025-02-13 11:00 (UTC+8)**

※In the event that the maintenance is extended, the dev team will issue a follow-up notice and adjust the compensation accordingly.  
  
**[How to Update]**  
Once the maintenance for the version update begins, you can follow the following instructions to update your client.

Select this option to pre-download the material for the latest version. You can continue playing the game while the pre-downloading process is ongoing. The process can be paused at any time. Whether it is complete or not, the update maintenance will speed up to a certain degree when initiated.

        <content type="text">The Black Shores has developed a special training program that can simulate dangerous trials in Solaris by using Tethys system data. The program is a good measure of the challenger&#39;s combat capabilities under adverse conditions.  
  
✦Duration✦

✦Eligibility✦  
Reach Union Level 30.  
  
✦Event Details✦  
- As a member of the Black Shores, take on Crisis Trial challenges and Disaster Trial high-difficulty challenges under various combinations of Stress Modules.  
- In Crisis Trials, select a Stress Level for each trial. The Stress Level must meet the requirements to complete the trial. Each trial has a default Stress Module. Support Modules are available to lower the trial&#39;s difficulty. After completing a Crisis Trial, the corresponding Disaster Trial along with its Stress Module and Support Module will be unlocked.  
- Disaster Trials have no required Stress Level. Participating in a Disaster Trial will consume Support Modules, so select them carefully in advance.  
- Obtain Matrix Crystals by completing Challenge Goals in the Crisis and Disaster Trials. Matrix Crystals can be exchanged for rewards at the Supply Station. The Supply Station closes when this event ends. Please exchange your Matrix Crystals in time.  
- Completing certain Stress Level challenges in Disaster Trials will grant the event-exclusive Title &#34;&#34;Virtual Trailblazer.&#34;&#34;  
  
※Certain high-difficulty Stress Modules can only be unlocked after clearing a Disaster Trial. Equipping too many Stress Modules may make the trial excessively challenging.  
※If a participant is downed in a trial, they can consume Stress Levels to revive. This also gives a corresponding buff. Please note that consuming Stress Levels will affect the completion and final result of Challenge Goals.</content>

To bring you exciting new content and a better gaming experience, we will soon be conducting the update maintenance for Version 2.3: Fiery Arpeggio of Summer Reunion.

During the maintenance, you will be unable to log in to the game, so please plan your time accordingly. Additionally, due to the large size of the update, we recommend updating the game while connected to a Wi-Fi network. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

        <title>Developer&#39;s Notes - Combat System</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/393" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">**Combat In Wuthering Waves**

The combat style of Wuthering Waves can be expressed in the three following aspects: &#34;Fast Pace Action&#34;, &#34;Visually Appealing Combat Representation&#34;, and &#34;Strategy Oriented Team Building&#34;.  
  
You would already have experienced the first two aspects during their initial engagement with the Crownless. Facing such a formidable foe also forces you to quickly master the techniques of offense and evasion as the battle continues, further sensing the intense build-up of tensions as blade and lance collide. You sure will gain a basic understanding of Wuthering Waves&#39; combat system after defeating the Crownless.

**Combat Movesets**

The movesets you would commonly use in combat can be summarized in the following categories:  
  
1. Normal Attack  
  
2. Evasion  
  
3. Resonance Skill  
  
4. Resonance Liberation  
  
5. Resonance Circuit  
  
6. Parry  
  
  
**1. Normal Attack**  
  
Every Resonator has their own set of Normal Attacks, which not only is the most commonly used means of offense, but also leads to a variety of fighting styles.  
  
Let&#39;s take An&#39;ke for example: as her Normal Attack progresses to the 4th stage, an &#34;Emotion Particle&#34; will show up around her. Quickly performing a follow-up Normal Attack within the Particle&#39;s duration will initiate an extra attack in the form of an enlarged Wooly. Tapping or clicking the attack button at the correct moment to enhance Normal Attacks brings more rhythm and enjoyment to overall combat, which also gives off the impression that An&#39;ke&#39;s usual fighting style is rather orderly and paced, which is a stark contrast to the combat style during her state of frenzy.

A Heavy Attack can be performed by holding down the Normal Attack button. Doing so usually consumes a certain amount of Stamina. However, Pistol-wielding Resonators will instead enter Aim Mode to execute a single, more powerful shot.  
  
In addition to being a much stronger Normal Attack, the Heavy Attack plays a crucial part for some of the Resonators during their combat.  
  
After Taoqi issues a Heavy Attack, she enters the state of &#34;Xuanwu&#39;s Defense&#34;, having her focus more on defense to reduce the amount of incoming damage by consuming Stamina. Once received enough damage, she dishes out a counterblow and heals her team members in the process.

Sanhua, on the other hand, can detonate &#34;Wall of Ice Picks&#34;, &#34;Ice Prisms&#34;, and &#34;Glaciers&#34; along the strike path of her Heavy Attack, which coupled with the perfect timing of a Resonance Skill will deal a serious blow to enemies in an instant.

Every Resonator has the capability to conduct attacks whilst midair, yet the methods vary depending on weapon type or the character themselves.  
  
During the limited time after performing his Resonance Skill, Jiyan is able to change his attack style in the air.

As for Chixia and many other Pistol-wielding Resonators, they will lay down continuous fire while in the air until Stamina is depleted.

Some Resonators can even perform midair Heavy Attacks.

**2. Evasion**  
  
By consuming a certain amount of Stamina, the controlling Resonator will perform a rapid Evasion toward the given direction. If no directional command is issued, the Resonator will automatically perform a backward Evasion.  
  
With the added priority granting the Evasion maneuver to interrupt a majority of actions midperformance, you may evade an enemy&#39;s attack right before contact, trigger an evasive counterattack, and create more offensive opportunities for yourself.

**3. Resonance Skill**  
  
Each Resonator bears their own unique Resonance Skill, while playing an important role in combat, it is often closely tied with the Resonator&#39;s Resonance Circuit and Resonance Liberation. Most Resonators require some time to recover after each use of their Resonance Skill, meaning mastering its timing is of utmost importance. However, there are occasional exceptions.  
  
Danjin consumes a certain amount of her HP each time she performs &#34;Vermilion Shards&#34; arts. Her Resonance Skill requires no recovery time. Arts from &#34;Vermilion Shards&#34; are combined with her Normal Attack, dealing continual damage to foes while recharging her &#34;Scarlet Essence&#34;. Once &#34;Scarlet Essence&#34; is fully recharged, Danjin can unleash even more deadly combos of attacks and regenerate her HP.

A style of combat featuring the cycle of consuming and regenerating HP, gives Danjin the power to deal massive amounts of damage to enemies, while simultaneously swaying herself at the edge of danger.

**4. Resonance Liberation**  
  
Resonance Energy can be accumulated by striking a target with the Resonance Skill, or when a Concerto Effect is triggered. Once Resonance Energy reaches its peak, a more powerful Resonance Liberation can be unleashed. Resonance Liberation is generally considered to be the most powerful ability of a Resonator. Activation of this ability can often turn the tide in battles. Besides dealing immense amounts of damage to enemies, Resonance Liberation also can enhance the capabilities of the caster or the entire team within a limited time frame.

For instance, Jiyan will enter his &#34;Triumphant Status&#34; after casting &#34;Sky Roaming - Certitude&#34;. His Claymore becomes a lance guiding the Qingloong&#39;s path, clearing any threat that poses to Huanglong.

Jueyuan&#39;s Resonance Liberation stimulates the growth of vegetation around her, dealing damage to enemies and marking them with &#34;Photosynthesis Sigil&#34;. Team members dealing damage to enemies marked with &#34;Photosynthesis Sigil&#34; will receive healing and collaborated attacks from Jueyuan. Jueyuan is a Resonator with combined offense and healing abilities.

**5. Resonance Circuit**  
  
Resonance Circuit is a form of distinctive energy held by Resonators, each Resonator&#39;s Resonance Circuit has its unique mechanic. To a certain extent, the Resonance Circuit determines the Resonator&#39;s main style of combat, whether it be Normal Attack, Resonance Skill, or Resonance Liberation, all tend to revolve around the effects of the Resonance Circuit. Grasping the Resonance Circuit&#39;s application during combat will lead to a better understanding of each Resonator&#39;s combat style.  
  
Thus, Rover&#39;s combat circulates the collection of &#34;Sound Fragments&#34; through constant strikes and evasions, &#34;Sound Fragments&#34; are then consumed with the use of the Resonance Skill for further damage and restoration of Resonance Energy, preparing for the next Resonance Liberation.  
  
The process is based on the mechanics of Rover&#39;s own Resonance Circuit, a complete combat cycle consisting of offense, evasion, and skills is formed.

Each Resonator has their own unique mechanic, which offers players rich combat experience and a feeling of control.

**6. Parry**  
  
In some situations, the enemy&#39;s execution of certain skills reveals a Parry opportunity, with a successful Parry disrupting the enemy&#39;s attack entirely and yielding surprising results.

**Concerto Between Resonators**

**1. Concerto Effect**  
  
Concerto Energy can be cumulated through dealing direct damage and using Echo Skills. Switching to another Resonator with Concerto Energy fully charged triggers the Concerto Effect of the corresponding Resonance Attribute. This action depletes your Concerto Energy.  
  
Due to differences in Resonance Attributes, there are five types of Concerto Effects: Unison, Ensemble, Sustenance, Legato, and Duet  
  
Each Concerto Effect displays a standalone result during combat, providing substantial support for Rovers during heated situations.  
  
This displays the importance of a reasonable team composition with the right Concerto Effects for the right occasions, putting Rover&#39;s strategy in team building to the test as well.  
  
Jiyan (Aero) partnered with Mortefi (Fusion) during combat sets off the &#34;Heat Ensemble&#34; effect, which awards the Resonator on the field with increased Attack and Critical Damage, suiting perfectly with Jiyan&#39;s fighting style.  
  
Followed by Mortefi unleashing his Resonance Liberation, all members of the team will be applied with &#34;Vulcan Rhapsody&#34;, a status which launches blazing &#34;Fusion Damage&#34; towards enemies with each Resonator&#39;s Normal or **Heavy Atack**.  
  
&#34;Heat Ensemble&#34; and &#34;Vulcan Rhapsody&#34;, along with Jiyan&#39;s &#34;Triumphant Status&#34;, a deadly combination that shall leave nothing but destruction for the enemies in its wake.

However, this is merely one of many examples showcasing the effective use of the Concerto Effect. A diverse collection of Resonators and Concerto Effects will enrich your combat experience.

**2. Concerto Skill (QTE)**  
  
Switch Resonators at the moment when Concerto Energy is maxed to carry out the Concerto Skill of the said Resonator. Different Resonators boast different Concerto Skills, appearing on the battlefield in varying ways and locations.

**Conclusion**  
  
In a world ridden with adversity, each Resonator revolves around their own Resonance Circuit and their team&#39;s Concerto Effect to resist the unending enemies. Accumulate Concerto Energy through attacks, skills, Echo Abilities, and other means, leading to the triggering of Concerto Effect to enhance the performances of the Resonator on the field. Finally, spend Resonance Energy to cast a powerful Resonance Liberation, dealing the enemy a final blow.  
  
Needless to say, this is only the tip of the iceberg of combat in Wuthering Waves. As you come across numerous Resonators during their journey, more and more combat features await to be uncovered.</content>

        <title>Developer&#39;s Notes — Sanhua</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/461" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">**Sanhua&#39;s Backstory**  
  
Sanhua is a Resonator who rarely lets her emotions show. You can sense a certain distance when you first meet her. Sanhua is also careful not to burden others with her actions. Perhaps, her personality stems from her tragic past.

Sanhua&#39;s tragedy started with a heavy snowfall. A sudden emergence of the Waveworn Phenomenon consumed the town where she resided. Sanhua was the sole survivor of this devastating catastrophe. While she managed to escape the clutches of the Tacet Discords, her right eye was injured. Sanhua was born blind, but the erosion of Waveworn Phenomenon gave her terrifying and anomalous vision.

In addition to her anomalous vision, this catastrophe also granted her a powerful Forte of ice manipulation. In her youth, Sanhua struggled to keep her Forte under control. Her body always emitted an unconscious, chilling coldness that repelled those around her.

Her life changed when she met Jinxi — the first person who appeared normal and untwisted in Sanhua&#39;s eyes. Jinxi gave her hope that destruction could also bring a new birth. As a result, Sanhua wholeheartedly pledged her loyalty to Jinxi,  and she has been tirelessly working towards creating the future they both dream of.

With the arrival of you, the Rover, Sanhua&#39;s world is poised for new and transformative changes: In her eyes, your frequency resonates with the same beauty and clarity that she once saw in Jinxi.  
  
  
**An All-round Guard**  
  
As Jinxi&#39;s guard, there&#39;s no doubt that Sanhua demonstrates exceptional physical prowess. In fact, she&#39;s capable of a lot more than that — Sanhua has a vast reserve of knowledge that enables her to respond fluently to any query. Her outstanding ability to remain composed enables her to handle emergencies flexibly. Furthermore, she boasts excellent cooking skills on par with a seasoned chef, and her adeptness in negotiations paves the way for successful deals.

Sanhua&#39;s capabilities extend beyond guarding— she&#39;s a proficient secretary as well. For example, she can finish all the paperwork for the next three months in a couple of days, and Jinxi would joke how Sanhua left her &#34;nothing to do&#34;; she can also deliver all three meals to Jinxi&#39;s doorway quietly, without ever being noticed... These tasks constitute her daily routine.

It&#39;s important to note that Sanhua wasn&#39;t inherently an all-rounder. Her versatility is a testament to her remarkable fast-learning ability. If she believes that a skill will help Jinxi, she is going to master it quickly without hesitation.  
  
  
**A Walking Ice Machine**  
  
Although Sanhua has fully mastered her Forte now, the changes in her mood continue to influence the temperature around her.

When Sanhua senses a lurking danger or unfriendly situation, delicate snowflakes materialize around her, serving as a clear sign that she is becoming defensive. Sometimes, these snowflakes appear not only in response to danger but also when she feels embarrassed or anxious. It is difficult for others to discern the exact trigger behind the emergence of these snowflakes, as Sanhua maintains a poker face.  
  
  
**R&amp;D Master of Loong Buns**  
  
Sanhua has a deep passion for improving her cooking abilities, especially when it comes to making Loong Buns. She is particularly motivated because Jinxi loves Loong Buns so much. Sanhua enjoys experimenting with various fillings to create different types of Loong Buns, just to listen to Jinxi&#39;s happy sigh as she savors the delicious treats. Now, Sanhua has a new &#34;customer&#34;, and that&#39;s the Rover. Sanhua aims to share the delightful taste of her Loong Buns with you. Therefore, her dedication to honing her cooking skills is stronger than ever.  
  
  
**A Hidden Side Revealed by Flower Beverage**  
  
Sanhua enjoys a unique beverage made from flower petals. However, she doesn&#39;t consume it regularly because she knows it can affect her work. When she drinks it, she becomes more lively and uninhibited. Although she appears normal on the outside, she speaks openly and reacts more slowly. She even resists taking breaks and can remain in this dreamy state for an entire day.  
  
  
**Sanhua&#39;s Appearance**  
  
Sanhua&#39;s tragic past and her role as a guard naturally paint her as low-key and distant. This led us to choose black as the dominant color to accentuate this aspect.

For her clothing style, we harmonized classical and contemporary elements. We chose a pure black beret for Sanhua, as it ensures that her silver hair doesn&#39;t attract excessive attention while aligning seamlessly with her attire. This fashion item brings out a cool and neat image of Sanhua.

When it comes to Sanhua&#39;s clothing and decorations, we incorporated a lot of &#34;Wave Patterns&#34;. Different from the &#34;Cloud Patterns&#34; that adorns Yangyang, these patterns yet share a similar style, adding a classical touch to the characters.

The pairing of black and gold, both muted colors, enhances their respective textures. With black as the dominant color, it effectively highlights the metallic and glossy essence of gold. Therefore, we adopted plenty of golden elements as embellishments in Sanhua&#39;s details. The golden pendant featuring the wave pattern further brings out Sanhua&#39;s heroic bearing on the battlefield.

Originally, Sanhua&#39;s eyes were gray. However, the influence of Tacet Discord&#39;s frequency transformed them both to striking crimson. Her Tacet Mark is located in her right eye&#39;s pupil and only appears when Sanhua uses her Resonance Skill.

**Sanhua&#39;s Fighting Style**  
  
Sanhua engages in battles with a calm demeanor, always striving to end the battle swiftly. Her skills are simple yet powerful. She mainly deals damage by detonating the ice creations created by her skills through enhanced Heavy Attacks. Once Sanhua sheaths her sword, the very traces of ice and snow that once existed vanish.  
  
  
**Forte Circuit**  
  
In order to minimize the negative effects of her anomalous vision, Sanhua relies on her sense of hearing to more accurately locate her enemies during battles.

Hold down the Normal Attack button then watch for the indicator above the character status bar. Release the button when the indicator moves inside the Frostbite area, and Sanhua will charge toward the target, performing an enhanced Heavy Attack.

This Heavy Attack detonates all Ice Prisms and Glaciers along the way.

Sanhua obtains 1 stack of Clarity upon releasing her Resonance Skill, Resonance Liberation, Concerto Skill, and the final strike of her Normal Attack. Every stack of Clarity expands the Frostbite area in Sanhua&#39;s character status bar, making it easier to trigger her enhanced Heavy Attack.  
  
  
**Resonance Skill**  
  
Sanhua leaps forward to perform a rapid slash attack while creating an Ice Prism on the field.  
  
  
**Resonance Liberation**  
  
Sanhua manipulates snow and slashes her sword forward for an AoE attack while creating a wall of Glaciers on the field.   
  
  
**Normal Attack**  
  
Fully aware of her Forte&#39;s potential danger, Sanhua restrains her ability when fighting. She only uses her sheath in the first three stages of her Normal Attack.

However, when confronted with a villain undeterred by her sheath strikes, Sanhua draws out her sword. With swift motion, she skillfully severs the villain&#39;s pant legs, which slide down to his feet, revealing his calves shivering with cold. This trick alone is enough to scare away most people with malicious intentions.  
  
Sanhua is a Resonator stoic, yet all-round on the battlefield. As you continue on your journey, you will have more opportunities to interact with her and grow your understanding of her in person.</content>

        <title>Developer&#39;s Notes — Aalto</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/497" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Aalto is a Congenital Resonator. He was born in the New Federation amidst a rare fog that had not been seen for years.  
  
  
  
**A Street Magician that Brings Joy**  
  
Aalto often entertains those with a long face with his magic tricks. In those performances, he shapes little animals with the mist created by his Forte, bringing joy to his audience. Sometimes they take the form of cute bunnies, other times majestic falcons, and even Encore&#39;s woolies.   
  
He is flexible like mist and sensitive like air. Aalto can read others&#39; feelings, enveloping them in a lighthearted atmosphere, much like mist. Wherever he goes, cheers and joy always follow him.  
  
  
  
**A Shrouded Man**  
  
Aalto&#39;s Forte allows him to conjure mist, shaping it into various forms, or briefly dissolving into it.  
  
Much like the ever-shifting mist, his personality is erratic and unpredictable as well. One can hardly tell his true intentions. After all, for an intelligence broker, concealing weaknesses and veiling true emotions is always the wisest choice.  
  
Yet, when Rover clears up the mist, Aalto&#39;s flippant and unreliable facade will be unveiled as mere camouflage. He is thoughtful and meticulous, always allowing him to resolve crises at critical moments. It is safe to conclude that Aalto is, in fact, a dependable man, contrary to what he appears to be.  
  
  
  
**A Scale of Transaction**  
  
On the surface, Aalto appears to be a greedy, venal broker, willing to strike deals with anyone for the right price. However, deep down, he knows well that intelligence can do either good or evil. This realization has led him to establish his own unique pricing criteria — his scale to determine the value of everything. No one can hustle a deal if it involves intelligence Aalto does not want to sell.  
  
Despite Aalto&#39;s catchphrase, &#34;Availability depends on remuneration&#34;, speculating the ideal offer for his intelligence — that is, ideal to Aalto — is never an easy task. Those with unrealistic dreams of amassing wealth by acquiring a piece of vital intelligence will find Aalto&#39;s quote astronomically high, whereas a lost girl can easily secure her mother&#39;s whereabouts from Aalto by offering him a piece of candy. No one knows what tips the balance on Aalto&#39;s scale to obtain the intelligence they desire. However, one thing is certain: you can never attempt to take advantage of Aalto or obtain anything from him that you don&#39;t rightfully deserve.  
  
  
  
**A Perfect Duo**  
  
Encore, a whimsical girl, is Aalto&#39;s best partner. Together, they embark on journeys filled with bustles while working on quests in the Black Shores. The odd pairing of an unreliable adult and a sensible child may seem peculiar to others, but surprisingly, it works.  
  
Whenever Aalto comes up with his wild plans, Encore is always the first to support him. Having been partners for a long time, she understands that there are always deeper meanings behind his ideas.  
  
To make things easier and gain the trust of people, the two would occasionally pose as a family, with Encore in charge of acting cute and Aalto being her miserable guardian. Although the two often squabble with each other, Aalto would always put Encore&#39;s safety first.  
  
  
  
**Aalto&#39;s Appearance**

The devices on Aalto&#39;s shoulders strengthen and store the mist he creates. Sometimes Aalto jokingly calls it fire spray on the go.

A seemingly inconspicuous bone flute that is, in fact, a tape recorder that Aalto has owned since he was a child. Aalto carries it with him on various occasions, and this small device has gathered a substantial amount of valuable intelligence for him.

A pair of sunglasses that Aalto always takes with him. They are essential for him when he wants to appear cool.

Aalto wears a Blake Bloom on his right shoulder to signify his membership with the Black Shores. Only individuals who receive Blake Blooms as invitations are allowed to set foot on the Black Shores&#39; soil.

Aalto&#39;s Terminal is Black Shores custom-made. It shares a modernist design style with the organization&#39;s buildings.  
  
  
  
**Aalto&#39;s Fighting Style**  
  
On the battlefield, Aalto&#39;s role is not that of a frontline warrior engaging enemies in close combat. Instead, he adopts a more strategic approach, maneuvering around the battle to support his allies. He can create Mist Avatars to taunt the enemies, and allow his teammates to deal damage safely. His Resonance Liberation creates a Gate of Quandary, which enhances ranged attacks launched from behind the Gate.  
  
  
**Forte Circuit**  
  
Mistified Shots: Ranged Normal Attacks and Mid-air Attacks deal Aero DMG after passing through the Mist Swirl.  
  
Mistform: Normal Attacks and Mid-air Attack bullets grant Aalto Mist Drops when they pass through Mist Swirls and land on targets. When Aalto passes through Mist Swirls, he enters Mistform and gains increased Movement Speed. In his Mistform, Aalto can continuously consume Mist Drops to conjure Mist Missiles that automatically lock onto enemies.

**Normal Attacks**  
  
Aalto fires multiple successive shots that generate a Mist Swirl to his front. Bullets passing through the Mist Swirl deal Aero DMG.  
  
  
  
**Resonance Skill**  
  
Aalto conjures a Mist Swirl and a Mist Avatar that taunts nearby targets, before creating Mist Missiles around the Mist Avatar, dealing Aero DMG.  
  
  
  
**Resonance Liberation**  
  
Aalto creates a Gate of Quandary in front of him. Bullets passing through it deal increased damage.  
  
Ranged Resonators work better with Aalto in combat. By taking advantage of Aalto&#39;s mist, they can protect themselves from enemy attacks and deal enhanced damage. As an intelligence broker, Aalto profits off danger, but direct confrontation with enemies isn&#39;t part of his strategy.  
  
  
  
This is all we can currently share about Aalto. The trajectory of his rise is still obscured in mist and awaits your discovery, dear Rovers.</content>

**✦MORTEFI✦**

        <title>Developer&#39;s Note — Mortefi</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/526" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Mortefi sports a neatly combed horsetail of crimson hair that cascades like a stream of flame. His eyes, deep-set and brimming with prideful aloofness, give off an air of elegant danger.  
  
Unlike the stereotypical researchers, who often come across as rigid and inarticulate, Mortefi exudes a sense of nobility. However, a fervent intensity lurks within his gaze. While his words are gracefully spoken, there lies a dormant dragon within him, nestled amidst the ashes. His politeness, akin to a thin layer of snow, conceals the fiery volcano that awaits its moment to erupt.

**Crimson Dragon Born in Flames**  
  
Mortefi&#39;s design draws inspiration from the legendary fire-breathing dragons of European folklore.  
  
His right chest bears a Tacet Mark, adorned with a striking red crystalline matter that extends down his right arm. These crystalline formations closely resemble the scales of a dragon. To conceal these unique features, Mortefi covers them with bandages and dons fire-resistant gloves. However, when his fury ignites, these &#34;scales&#34; grow exponentially.  
  
The red crystalline substance grants him the ability to manipulate fire. With subtle guidance, he can channel flames down the scales on his arm, creating a mesmerizing display reminiscent of a dragon&#39;s mighty claw. When Mortefi fully unleashes his Forte, a spectral dragon manifests behind him, its form composed of blazing petals that dance and flicker with intensity.

**An Elegant Geek**  
  
Classical music always fills the air in Mortefi&#39;s laboratory, providing the perfect backdrop for his work. With the intricate and precise compositions serving as his muse, Mortefi would write scientific equations with flames in the air as he contemplated his latest research, much like a devoted conductor leading an orchestra.  
  
Even on the busiest of research days, Mortefi never neglects his afternoon tea ritual. He firmly believes that indulging in fine desserts helps replenish the energy his brilliant mind consumes.  
  
While Mortefi&#39;s noble heritage demands a flawless image, he devotes minimal time to anything other than his research. His crimson hair, though simply combed, always remains impeccably neat. Similarly, Mortefi&#39;s pristine white robe, his constant attire, rarely bears any signs of wrinkles or stains. His obsession with cleanliness and orderliness extends seamlessly into his laboratory, where everything is meticulously arranged.  
  
  
  
  
**Hubristic, Irritable, but Never Cruel**  
  
The combination of Mortefi&#39;s chilling face and proud eyes immediately convey that he is not someone amiable.   
  
His patience for anything outside of his lab is incredibly limited, easily leading to agitation. In these moments, he subconsciously starts fidgeting with a lighter adorned with dragon patterns.   
  
Usually, Mortefi doesn&#39;t use this lighter for ignition; but once the bear is poked, he won&#39;t need a lighter for fire anyway.  
  
In European folklore, dragons are often associated with chaos and evil, known as fire breathers and fearmongers. Mortefi, however, never uses his fire irresponsibly.   
  
Born into nobility, he was raised and educated in a manner that molded his hubris and grace. Yet, amidst the aristocratic circles he inhabited, he couldn&#39;t help but notice the hypocrisy and indifference that pervaded their interactions. This realization ignited a flame within him, one that he cleverly wielded to mock the imperious and scorch those lacking sincerity.

**Dragon? Grumpy Cat!**  
  
Mortefi is not one to get angry for no reason. Deep down, he is a gentle soul who responds well to coaxing. Whenever he starts getting cranky, a small concession from his funders, accompanied by praise for his creations, is all it takes to make him approachable once again.  
  
In fact, as long as you can clearly articulate what kind of invention you want, he is willing to strive towards making your desires a reality, no matter how unrealistic they may sound. Sometimes, this irritable &#34;Red Dragon&#34; feels more like a grumpy, puffed-up cat, who can be easily appeased with simple petting.  
  
Perhaps you could even try keeping Mortefi in a state of alternating calm and anger by provoking him and then immediately offering consolation? Do it at your own risk, though...

**A Fire Exclusive to Mortefi**  
  
Flames manifest in various hues. Mortefi&#39;s fire possesses a distinct crimson color that symbolizes unbridled wrath. It mirrors the blistering flow of lava beneath solid stone and smoldering cinder. Born from his repressed childhood and taxing career, this fire within him ignited under certain circumstances. Fueling his heart with wrath, Mortefi harnesses his blaze to incinerate hypocrites and snobs who dare cross his path.  
  
However, his flames now find a different purpose as he dedicates himself to research. As long as his temper remains ablaze, the fire within Mortefi will never cease.   
  
Perhaps, as a brilliant inventor, he has already planned the intricate circuitry that fuels his fury.

**Blaze Blooms in Bile**  
  
Mortefi&#39;s fire is a substantialization of his accumulated negative emotions. As the combat unfolds, Annoyance builds up in him, which, when fully charged, will result in an enhanced Resonance Skill. By then, his enemy will know the furious Dragon&#39;s flame.  
  
  
  
  
**Basic Attack**  
  
Mortefi uses pistols empowered with Tacetite energy.   
  
He shoots gracefully and lethally. Every shot that hits the enemies builds up his Annoyance.  
  
Hold down the attack button, and Mortefi will gracefully aim at enemies with even greater precision, unleashing enhanced shots that inflict more damage.

**Resonance Skill**  
  
The Red Dragon roars amidst the ashes of its enemies, unleashing fiery blazes as a form of punishment. Mortefi swiftly fires a blaze towards the front, simultaneously building up Annoyance.  
  
When Annoyance is maxed, Mortefi&#39;s Resonance Skill is immediately refreshed and enhanced. His enhanced Resonance Skill utilizes all the stored Annoyance to release a scorching streak of flames, inflicting greater damage upon a wider range of enemies.

**Forte Circuit**  
  
Mortefi is always suppressing his temper, but the flames he controls in battle only serve to further fuel his frustration. Once Annoyance is maxed, Mortefi fully embraces the Red Dragon of his wrath. Summoning a spectral dragon from the fiery depths, Mortefi unleashes it upon a broader array of foes, while simultaneously expending all of his built-up Annoyance.  
  
  
  
  
**Resonance Liberation**  
  
The Red Dragon asserts his dignity through fiery flames. Mortefi inflicts aerial damage upon nearby enemies.   
  
As the waves of fire intensify, his adversaries have no choice but to surrender to the Dragon&#39;s awe-inspiring presence.

---

This is all we have to share at the moment about Mortefi, the brilliant inventor with a fiery temper, and a nobleman whose impatience yearns for a soothing touch.</content>

        <title>Developer&#39;s Notes — Danjin</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/549" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">This time, we would like to introduce to you the backstory of Danjin, a red-haired ranger girl.

**Danjin&#39;s Appearance**  
  
Danjin is a girl whose fiery red hair is as vibrant as balsam. Both her hair and her attire exude this striking hue.  
  
Elegantly styled in a youthful bun, her hair is adorned with a vintage hairpin at the temple, adding a touch of cuteness to her already charming appearance. Her clothing, steeped in traditional Chinese style, is specially tailored for ease of movement, from the satin ribbons to the ring-shaped neck ornament known as Yingluo, and even the crimson leg garter adorning her right thigh. All these elements come together to express the liveliness of a young girl.  
  
Amidst the deep red tones that envelop her, a clear and bright jade pendant hangs from Danjin&#39;s neck. In her hometown, a beautiful jade is referred to as &#34;Jin,&#34; a name she shares. It is evident that this jade holds great significance for her. However, the pendant was once part of a perfect circle, and the missing piece remains a mystery, leaving a sense of intrigue.  
  
  
  
  
  
**A Sweet and Righteous Ranger Girl**  
  
Danjin&#39;s jade pendant carries her family&#39;s blessings, as her parents wished for her to grow into an upright and virtuous person. When she was younger, Danjin didn&#39;t fully understand the meaning of being &#34;upright and virtuous.&#34; As she later embarked on a journey in search of a certain criminal, she gradually came to understand the true essence of her parents&#39; wishes.   
  
With a polite ranger tone and graceful actions, she embodies the heroic spirit of a dedicated martial artist and swordswoman. Her unwavering gaze reflects her pure intentions, free from any malice.  
  
Despite her mature demeanor, Danjin has a sweet tooth and a particular fondness for the renowned Huanglong dessert, Loong Whiskers Crisp. When people catch a glimpse of her savoring the crisp with sheer delight, they are reminded that she is, after all, still a young girl.

**A Virtuous Maiden**  
  
Despite her youth, Danjin is far from a dreamy-eyed idealist.   
  
Her disgust is palpable whenever she speaks of her encounters with wrongdoers, revealing a clear understanding of right and wrong. Even when criminals attempt to deceive her with their silver tongues, she remains unfazed.   
  
Danjin fearlessly points out the truth without hesitation, a quality that may appear naive. However, it is precisely this quality that garners her the respect of others.

Over time, tales spread of a young girl adorned in crimson, her neck adorned with a jade pendant.   
  
Some recall witnessing a young girl &#34;falling prey&#34; to deceitful villains, yet their own fear held them back from speaking up. However, they later learned that those villains had mysteriously vanished, never to be seen again. Others speak of a girl wandering with a worn-out blade, fervently seeking a blacksmith to restore it. As the tale is told, she appears to possess the aura of a formidable berserker.

**Danjin&#39;s Fighting Style**  
  
Danjin wields her blood as a blade, its edge honed by the blood of her enemies. In battle, she harnesses her own blood to create a second sword. Danjin can sacrifice her own HP to amplify the damage she inflicts.  
  
**Normal Attacks**  
  
Danjin swiftly thrusts her sword at her enemy.  
  
When dealing Heavy Attacks, Danjin delivers three rapid slashes in a row.

**Resonance Skill**  
  
Danjin consumes her HP to create a Crimson Blade. Her skill is performed in different ways based on the number of attacks she executes:  
  
Releasing her Resonance Skill after 1 Normal Attack, she unleashes a fierce upward slash towards her enemy.  
  
Releasing her Resonance Skill after 2 Normal Attacks, she executes a cross-shaped slash with her sword and blood sword.  
  
Releasing her Resonance Skill after 3 Normal Attacks, she performs a rapid succession of slashes.

**Forte Circuit**  
  
Danjin&#39;s Forte Gauge fills up as she uses her Resonance Skill. When the Forte Gauge is full, her Heavy Attacks will steal the enemy&#39;s HP.

**Resonance Liberation**  
  
After Danjin releases her Resonance Liberation, she performs multiple slashes in quick succession. Glimmers of the swords dance like flowing water upon the bodies of her foes, eventually converging into a sea of darkness tinged with red.

Danjin travels in the world at a young age. Along the way, she discovers the profound essence of righteousness and virtue. Her initial quest for revenge on behalf of her family gradually morphs into a noble mission to rid the world of evil.  
  
This lone ranger girl lives a life of constant battles. Amidst the clatter of metal, Danjin stands unfazed. Even as her clothes become stained with blood, her jade pendant remains unblemished, signifying her unwavering will.</content>

        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/573" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">**Yuanwu&#39;s Story**  
  
Yuanwu is a martial artist known for his mastery of Leihuangquan, a swift and powerful style named after lightning and thunder. His lightning-fast fists strike with streaks of blue energy, leaving his opponents reeling from the full force of their destructive power.  
  
As a teenager, Yuanwu sought absolute power and relied on raw force to defeat his enemies. This obsession led to his downfall, as he fell into a trap laid by his rival and was exiled from his home.  
  
During his years of wandering, Yuanwu reflected on his past mistakes and honed his martial arts skills. With his expanding knowledge and improved techniques, he gradually grasped the essence of Leihuangquan — the art of balance between strength and adaptability. A martial artist&#39;s path of vengeance is destined to begin and end on the fighting ground. As fate would have it, his sworn enemy crossed paths with him once again in the arena, where their conflict would come to its ultimate climax.  
  
As lightning flashed, Yuanwu&#39;s fist broke through his opponent&#39;s gauntlet, revealing the illegal add-on hidden within. This moment marked Yuanwu&#39;s mastery of Leihuangquan, and exposed the years of lies and slander that had been concealed for ages.  
  
The tale of Yuanwu&#39;s vengeance drew to a close, but his story as a boxing gym owner was only beginning.  
  
&#34;Welcome to Yuanwu’s Boxing Gym.&#34;   
  
Yuanwu, now an amiable middle-aged proprietor, can always be found at the entrance of his boxing gym, greeting visitors with a warm smile daily.  
  
  
  
**A Modest Gentleman**  
  
Gone are the days when the young Yuanwu fought his way with brute force. He has matured into a composed and confident middle-aged gentleman.  
  
Yuanwu dons a dark-colored coat paired with a white top hat that perfectly aligns with his composed, modest, and courteous demeanor. The tailored waistcoat underneath highlights his robust physique, reflecting his years of martial arts training. The addition of navy blue in his attire further elevates the impression of thunder and lightning.  
  
Though known to those around him as a kind gentleman, Yuanwu sheds his usual composed demeanor when faced with combat. He swiftly unleashes precise and fierce strikes, overwhelming his opponents. Yuanwu does not like to engage in physical altercations, but once forced into it, he throws himself fully into the fight, aiming for a quick and resounding victory.

**A Dedicated Mentor**  
  
In Yuanwu&#39;s boxing gym, every visitor can receive dedicated coaching from the owner himself.  
  
Whether the person wants to exercise, pursue a career in boxing, or simply soak up the energizing ambiance of the gym, Yuanwu is always ready to suggest tailored training plans based on their unique physical abilities and health needs.  
  
At the end of every training session, Yuanwu always graciously serves his clients with a cup of Trine Tea.  He takes great care in preparing each cup himself. The steaming hot tea effectively soothes the sore muscles and fatigue from the intense workout. Yuanwu&#39;s boxing gym is a unique place where clients can engage in a spirited boxing match and then relax with a pot of tea, basking in comfort and contentment.  
  
  
  
**Yuanwu’s Secret For Wellness**  
  
Yuanwu is a regular consumer of Bittberry Tea from the renowned Liuxian Teahouse. This secret blend is known for its intense bitterness and exorbitant price, making it a luxury only a select few can afford. Rumor has it that Yuanwu is the only one who can down a cup without flinching.  
  
Yuanwu always carries a flask with him during his daily activities. Some say it contains his secret potion for staying fit, but in reality, it&#39;s usually just ordinary hot water.

**Yuanwu&#39;s Fighting Style**  
  
When in combat, Yuanwu maintains his elegant composure. His mastery of lightning manipulation amplifies his team&#39;s capabilities and shines through in his impressive combat skills. When the situation turns dire, Yuanwu can take charge as the team&#39;s primary damage dealer, unleashing powerful fists of twisting thunder to crush any enemy in their path.  
  
  
  
  
**Normal Attacks**  
  
Yuanwu performs up to five consecutive strikes with swift punches and kicks.  
  
Being the gentleman that he is, Yuanwu gracefully removes his top hat as a salutation before engaging in combat, a gesture that is also integrated into the movement design of his Normal Attacks.  
  
  
  
**Resonance Skill**  
  
Yuanwu converges Electro energy to summon a pillar of thunder which generates an electric field.  
  
Attacks performed by all team members within this field trigger the pillar&#39;s coordinated attacks, dealing Electro damage.  
  
While present, the pillar continuously fills up Yuanwu&#39;s Forte Gauge. The coordinated attacks triggered accelerate his Forte Gauge.  
  
  
  
**Forte Circuit**  
  
Once Yuanwu&#39;s Forte Gauge is fully charged, hold down the Resonance Skill button to consume all of his Forte Gauge energy and enter an enhanced state.  
  
In this state, Yuanwu gains increased resistance to interruption and his attacks are enhanced: His Basic Attacks have added SFX and a wider range, while Heavy Attack, Extreme Evasion, and Parry trigger additional Electro damage.  
  
  
  
**Resonance Liberation**  
  
Lightning of dark blue converges upon Yuanwu&#39;s fists before setting loose onto his opponents in a bombardment of punches. The raging thunderstorm inflicts two consecutive hits of ranged AOE damage upon enemies to his front. The released lightning energy also grants all team members increased resistance to interruption.

The roaring thunder can conquer any enemy, but it may also scar its wielder in turn. Yuanwu has come to learn the importance of balancing strength and flexibility for lasting success, but he is not one to impose his knowledge on others. If someone were to seek his advice, he would simply suggest taking a moment to relax, savor a cup of tea, and follow their intuition in navigating life&#39;s challenges.</content>

**✦Taoqi✦**  
  
Taoqi is the director of border defense at the Ministry of Development. Despite her seemingly laid-back demeanor, she consistently proves to be a dependable and supportive individual, always lending her hand to those in need. Taoqi is not only a reliable colleague but also a trustworthy friend that people can confide in.</content>

        <title>Developer&#39;s Notes —Taoqi</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/589" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">**Taoqi&#39;s Look**  
  
Taoqi, a mature Resonator with a laid-back personality, exudes a sense of understanding and protection.  
  
She patiently listens to others&#39; troubles and offers guidance with calm deliberation. Though she carries a relaxed and gentle aura, she becomes determined and resolute when making promises. This has earned her the role of a dependable big sister figure, despite her age.  
  
Taoqi&#39;s lazy nature is evident in her lifestyle — she always carries a heating eye mask for impromptu naps on soft surfaces like beds or sofas. She loves dozing off while leaning on her friends&#39; shoulders.  
  
  
  
**Taoqi****&#39;s****Trouble**  
  
Known as a trustworthy and caring big sister, Taoqi is often sought out for advice. From career to relationship issues, people confide in her, leading some to label her the &#34;Gossip Queen.&#34;   
  
In fact, Taoqi simply listens and observes, offering guidance to those who seek it. She has no interest in spreading rumors or using others&#39; words for entertainment, instead focusing on helping them solve their problems.  
  
  
  
**Taoqi&#39;s Work-life Balance**  
  
Taoqi believes in maintaining a clear boundary between work and personal life for success.  
  
Nothing stops Taoqi from getting off work on time. Once she clocks out, she is unreachable and colleagues only find her notes. She would be in the comfort of her home, organizing the day&#39;s tasks while resting on her trusty Peachy Turtle pillow. She will not fall asleep until she has made sure everything is in order.  
  
At work, Taoqi excels in efficiency and attention to detail, earning a reputation for reliability among her colleagues. Her ultimate dream is a future with less work and more relaxation. But for now, she remains dedicated to protecting the city of Jinzhou. Until her goal is achieved, Taoqi will continue her vigilant approach to safeguarding the community and ensuring peaceful days for all.  
  
  
  
**The Unhurried Guardian**  
  
Taoqi is known for her slow and deliberate movements. However, this same quality has made her a strong and dependable protector.  
  
As a child, she faced bullying for her pace but found solace in those who patiently waited for her. As she grew up, she eventually found her strength in slowness to protect the ones she cherished.  
  
As an adult, Taoqi uses keen observation and thoughtful planning to safeguard the people of Jinzhou. Her deliberate nature is not a weakness; instead, it has allowed her to establish a reliable defense system for the city.  
  
Though not one for frontline battles, she diligently works in the background, orchestrating defense strategies and supporting civilians. Her strength lies in bringing peace to chaotic situations and protecting those she cares for.  
  
But when needed, Taoqi can hold her own in combat with skill and precision.  
  
  
  
**Taoqi&#39;s Fighting Style**  
  
As a reassuring presence in the team, Taoqi excellently assumes the responsibility of the protector. Much of her ability goes under her unique defense mechanisms. Use her ability wisely, and then every member of the team will be protected.  
  
  
  
**Normal Attack**  
  
Taoqi may seem laid-back, but her prowess in battle is unmatched. With her broadblade, she effortlessly lands consecutive strikes.   
  
Taoqi&#39;s heavy attack allows her to switch to a special Parry state. In this state, she can mitigate incoming damage.  
  
  
  
**Resonance Skill**  
  
Taoqi deals aerial damage to nearby enemies, restoring HP and generating shields around herself.  
  
When the currently on-filed character is attacked, a shield is consumed to absorb the damage taken.  
  
Additionally, when Taoqi is attacked, her Forte Gauge increases from the shield consumed.  
  
  
  
**Forte Circuit**  
  
Once Taoqi&#39;s Forte Gauge is sufficiently charged, her next heavy attack is enhanced.  
  
With this enhanced heavy attack, Taoqi immediately unleashes a powerful counterattack against any incoming enemy attack, and she gains shields afterwards. This ends Taoqi&#39;s Parry state.  
  
Her following basic attacks consume the remaining Forte Gauge to give her and her teammates shields that mitigate damage.  
  
  
  
**Resonance Liberation**  
  
In the midst of battle, Taoqi remains true to her lazy demeanor. She yawns before wielding her blade for a powerful, wide-range slash that deals Havoc damage. The outburst of energy also generates a special force field that slows down enemies within its confines.</content>

        <title>Wuthering Waves: Developer&#39;s Message</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/630" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Greetings, Rovers!  
  
It has been a while since the previous Wuthering Waves beta test.   
  
First and foremost, we would like to express our gratitude to each and every one of you who have been following and supporting the development of Wuthering Waves. During this interlude, our team has made extensive changes, adjustments, and optimizations to the game contents based on feedback and suggestions we received from you. Before you embark on the next round of testing, we would like to share with you a summary of our development process over the past 10 months, and also a few &#34;sneak peeks&#34; of some new content that will be featured in the second closed beta test.  
  
  
**Story Revision**  
  
Stories are a crucial part of a world as expansive as Wuthering Waves and have been our priority in the list changes. During this period, we performed a thorough overhaul of the in-game stories, removed settings that were deemed unsatisfactory, and made adjustments to character designs accordingly. With the above changes, necessary modifications also needed to be made to the overall story flow, animations, voice-overs, and other resources.  
  
In this iteration of the test, we have implemented the [Skip] function, which aims to improve the players&#39; overall speed and pacing when experiencing some story missions. In addition, the inclusion of Resonator story missions for Jiyan and Lingyang will help players fully experience the charm of these Resonators, in conjunction with supporting game modes to gain a grasp of a more immersive gaming experience.

**Improvements to Combat**  
  
The combat system from the previous beta was well-received by the community. Using it as the foundation, we have made optimizations to the overall combat loop experience centered around the &#34;Intro Skill - Outro Skill.&#34; Detailed adjustments were made to aspects such as — character skill effects, general combat mechanics, screen shaking, camera lock-on, etc. Echo skills were also further improved, giving them smoother performances, and Echo skills boasting special utilities will also serve as countermeasures during necessary combat situations.  
  
Three new Resonators, Jianxin, Lingyang, and Calcharo, have been introduced into the game for players to experience, along with three Bosses, Impermanence Heron, Mech Abomination, and Tempest Mephis, plus a new phase for Scar.  
  
While reducing the complexity for players to gain the know-how of the in-game combat system, we also added high-difficulty elites and the &#34;Tactical Hologram: Calamity&#34; game modes placed around various areas of the map, which greatly reward players that are seeking for challenges.   
  
Our goal is for players, regardless of skill level or appeal for action games, to become engaged as quickly as possible, and fully experience the smooth and satisfying combat Wuthering Waves has to offer.  
  
  
**Graphics Quality Improvements**  
  
The adjustments to the in-game visuals introduce a more comfortable and polished appearance. Internally, the team implemented a more detailed atmosphere tier system to address the player feedback of visual fatigue experienced from the previous test. Thus, focused optimizations were put into place to model renderings, shapes, special effects, clothing designs, etc. based on characters&#39; appearances.  
  
During this test, players will have the opportunity to witness and be immersed in weather phenomena like the Etheric Sea, Celestial Anomaly, and Retroact Rain, unique to the world of Wuthering Waves. In specific areas, distinctively designed sceneries have been placed by combining our concept designs, hoping to bring players a different experience.

**Optimizations to Echoes and New In-Game Events**  
  
Compared to the previous test, we included a dedicated tutorial guide for the Echo system, while also lowering the difficulty of discovering and obtaining Echoes. After obtaining an Echo for the first time, the chances of reobtaining it in the same Tacet Field will be increased the more you challenge it. The current Echo kit adopts a tag-based system, which makes for versatile combinations and strategies based on the circumstances. Players will now also have the opportunity to encounter and collect &#34;Illusive Echoes&#34; (final name may vary in-game). These Echoes possess special appearances and features, but we won&#39;t spoil them just yet!  
  
Last but not least, for the first time, limited-time in-game events such as the &#34;Depths of Illusive Realm&#34; and &#34;Overdash Club&#34; track challenge will also be available for experiencing in this test.

As the game is currently in its development phase, some of the content players experience are still work-in-progress builds, which may lead to unpleasant gaming experiences — Players will find some voice-over content for the characters and storylines absent within the game, but rest assured, these contents are undergoing rigorous development as we perform further improvements to the game. Players participating in the beta test from mobile devices may experience increased power consumption, overheating, and other issues for certain devices. Cross-platform performance, various UI interfaces, in-game text localizations, and existing voice-overs will also undergo further optimizations down the line. We wish to extend our appreciation for the understanding and support you have given us thus far.  
  
We are deeply aware that the game still has many shortcomings, and your feedback and suggestions propel us to strive towards the goal of presenting a game &#34;enjoyed by all Rovers&#34;, as we will continue to carry out new features and enhancements to the game. Stay tuned to future Developer&#39;s Messages on further updates and improvements to Wuthering Waves.  
  
Thank you for being part of the Wuthering Waves community, and we hope to see you soon in the upcoming closed beta test!

        <title>Developer&#39;s Message: CLOSED BETA TEST II Review</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/690" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Dear Rovers,  
  
We would like to first express our sincere gratitude. Thank you for participating in and paying attention to our Closed Beta Test II. We received a lot of valuable feedback from all platforms.   
  
After careful consideration, we have finalized our plans for future adjustments and optimizations, and we would like to share them with you.   
  
We hope this Developer&#39;s Message addresses any questions you may have. Your continued support means the world to us.  
  
  
**A. COMBAT**  
  
1. Overall Combat Experience Optimizations  
  
We are addressing the issue of poor sound effects and hit feedback many of our players mentioned. We will focus on revamping the sound effects of weapon hit feedback, Echo Skills, Resonance Skills, and other battle aspects. In addition, we&#39;ll improve jumping by adjusting animation speed, camera transitions, and landing feedback to make it feel more natural.  
  
2. Character-specific Combat Optimizations  
  
We will be making specific adjustments for characters frequently mentioned in the feedback we received.   
  
Our current plans include:  
  
① Adjust Lingyang and Jianxin&#39;s movesets for an elevated overall combat experience;   
  
② Adjust Verina&#39;s HP restoration mechanism so she can use her Photosynthesis Energy more efficiently;  
  
③ Improve Calcharo&#39;s kit. His extra Intro Skill &#34;Necessary Means&#34; will be available by default.  
  
3. New Combat Skill Practicing Dungeons  
  
We will introduce a series of new Combat Practicing dungeons where you can better familiarize yourself with each character&#39;s unique combat mechanisms, and practice how to combo.

Aside from the points above, we have also started working on other frequently reported issues, such as bad camera experiences, frequent lock-on loss, enemies quitting combat, and counterattack failures.  
  
  
**B. GAMEPLAY**  
  
1. Echo System  
  
We received a lot of feedback on the Echo system. Thank you so much for taking the time to test out this system and providing valuable suggestions!   
  
We have received many suggestions and concerns about how the Echo hunting experience was too grindy, how the game lacked disposal options for unwanted Echoes, and other issues.  
  
To address these issues, we are planning to implement the following changes:  
  
① Make it easier to obtain various Echoes.   
  
We plan to make Echoes available through participating in-game events, completing daily activities, and other means.  
  
② Provide a better way to dispose of unused or redundant Echoes.  
  
You will be able to recycle unenhanced Echoes by converting them into random new Echoes of a type you have unlocked.  
  
③ Return Turners when Tuned Echoes are consumed.  
  
When you use Tuned Echoes to upgrade other Echoes, a designated % of Tuners you previously used will be returned.  
  
④ Make it easier to get your desired Substats.  
  
We will raise the minimum numbers you can get with substats rolling, and narrow the range of possible rolling results.  
  
⑤ Optimize the auto-equip Echoes mechanism.  
  
Additionally, we will improve Inferno Rider&#39;s Echo Skill to add a new transformation mode. When equipped, you can transform into the Infernal Rider.   
  
We will be developing even more new events and new gameplays centered around the Echoes, and improve them based on your feedback to create unique experiences.  
  
  
  
2. New Content for &#34;Depths of Illusive Realm&#34;  
  
We will add a Tutorial Stage for &#34;Depths of Illusive Realm&#34; to help beginners better understand and enjoy this gameplay.   
  
More playable characters will be added in &#34;Deapths of Illusive Realms&#34;. Additionally, you will also be able to use trial characters in this mode. Meanwhile, new high-difficulty events and special boss mechanisms will be added for you to challenge.  
  
We are also working on other gameplay issues mentioned in your feedback. 

Here are a few examples: Drops from Supply Chests or enemies in the wild will be automatically picked up; Co-op mode will be available sooner, at a lower Union Level; A batch salvaging option for unwanted items in your backpack... We hope these changes can further improve your game experience.  
  
  
**C. STORY CUTSCENES &amp; ANIMATIONS**  
  
We are working on the frequently reported issues about story cutscenes &amp; animations, including strange camera positionings, characters showing up at the wrong time, poorly matched lip animations, and lack of detail in story sound effects. Here are some of the progress we&#39;ve made so far:  
  
① Optimized the camera positioning and character animation in some parts of the story. Improved lip animation and eyeblink animation.  
  
② Adjusted and rearranged the story quests’ progression for a smoother flow, and changed the unlock prerequisites for some story quests.  
  
③ Reworked the sound effects in cutscenes for a better performance.  
  
④ Improved the &#34;Skip&#34; function to make it work better.  
  
We will keep polishing every detail of story cutscenes and animations to optimize the quality. We hope this will help you better enjoy the story quests.  
  
  
**D. OTHER OPTIMIZATIONS &amp; ADJUSTMENTS**  
  
Aside from the changes above, we are addressing game issues such as crashes, blank screens, frame drops, and device overheating. Improving game performance on all devices is a top priority. We&#39;re also improving the Character and Environment Designs and adjusting the UI for easier navigation. New events and story content are in early development and we&#39;ll share our progress with you.  
  
  
**E. LOCALIZATION**  
  
We take localization quality very seriously, and it is also a big part of our future optimization plans. We will continuously improve the localization quality based on your feedback. We are working on adding EN/JP/KR voice-overs for stories and character voicelines. Thank you for your patience!  
  
  
  
These are our future adjustments and optimizations based on the feedback we received during CBT II. These are our future adjustments and optimizations based on the feedback we received during CBT II. We apologize for any deficiencies or unsatisfactory content in the beta test build. The development team is committed to addressing these issues and prioritizing areas that were less enjoyable for players. Our goal is to bring you an even better version of Wuthering Waves next time.  
  
  
Thank you again for your continued attention and support!

        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/777" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">**1. The &#34;Login Timeout&#34; issue:**  
  
Some players may have encountered a &#34;Login Timeout&#34; error while trying to log in to the game. This has been fixed and was found to be related to certain network service providers. If you still experience this issue, please contact customer service with your device model and carrier for further investigation.  
  
  
**2. Players in certain areas cannot perform age authentication:**  
  
In certain areas, players may have difficulty performing age authentication if their mobile phone is in &#34;Night Mode&#34;. We are currently investigating this issue.  
  
  
**3. Players may need to log in again every time the game client is relaunched on PC:**  
  
This happens when exiting the game using the power icon in the bottom-left corner on the ESC menu, which brings you back to the title screen. In this case, you would need to log in again when resuming the game. We are aware of this issue and are working on optimizing the UI to prevent confusion in future updates.  
  
  
**4. About Unreal Engine 4 crash reports:**  
  
Some players may receive error messages from Unreal Engine 4 and experience crashes while loading the splash screens. There are multiple factors that could have caused this issue. We&#39;re collecting the relevant error details and identifying the cause. We&#39;ll fix this issue as soon as possible with a patch.  
  
  
**5. About the compatibility issue with certain Android devices:**  
  
It has been brought to our attention that Rovers playing from certain Samsung devices with Exynos series processors may encounter glitches with character actions and movements. We have identified the cause of the problem and will fix this issue through a patch as soon as possible.  
  
  
**6. About localization quality:**  
  
We have received feedback regarding the localization quality of the game. Ensuring high-quality localization has always been a priority for us, and we are fully committed to improving it. Currently, our team is endeavoring to continuously rectify and optimize the localized texts to provide an enjoyable experience for Rovers everywhere. Fixes to some of the known issues with the current localized texts will be included in the patches to be released soon. Meanwhile, if you have any feedback regarding localization, please reach out to our Customer Support at: **[wutheringwaves\_ensupport@kurogames.com](&lt;wutheringwaves_ensupport@kurogames.com&gt;)**  
  
  
**7. About the performance issues:**  
  
We are aware of a series of performance issues our players have experienced (e.g. lags, freezes, frame rate drops, device overheating, blurry graphics, crashes, or force quits) and we are working to identify the causes and address these issues.  
  
In addition, we have included fixes to some of the most urgent issues with the broadest impact (e.g. login failures or overheating) in an emergency patch to ensure the stability of the game for most players. However, if you continue to experience serious overheating or frequent crashes in the current version, please consider checking your device load status via [Settings] - [Graphics] and lower the graphics settings in the case of an overload for a smoother gaming experience.  
  
Lastly, our team would like to thank all players again for your support and understanding.   
  
Please rest assured that we are dedicated to providing the best possible experience for our players, and we take performance concerns seriously. In future updates, we will continue to optimize the game&#39;s performance to improve your gaming experience. Please stay tuned to our upcoming notices and announcements.</content>

3.  Support the skipping of character dialogs outside of cutscenes and cinematics.  
  
4. The Companion Story for Resonator Yinlin will be available in-game soon.  
  
Due to technical constraints, we&#39;re unable to support the skipping of cutscenes. Sorry for any negative experience this may bring. We appreciate your understanding!  
  
**(2) Optimize the combat experience**  
  
With regard to the issues that frequently come up in the feedback of all Rovers, including the lack of signification of combat actions, lack of visual feedback of action impacts, poor controller combat experience, and visual blockage during the combat by environmental objects. We have scheduled dedicated optimization of different combat scenes with the goal of improving the positive feedback for players in the combat experience. Additionally, we are also working on improving the functional support of controllers and expediting the support of customized buttons of controllers.  
  
**(3) Additional Custom 5-Star Standard Resonator Giveback Convene event**  
  
After the launch, we have received much feedback across all platforms and channels regarding the Beginner&#39;s Choice Convene. We are deeply sorry for the unsatisfactory experience the event has brought you. Therefore, we plan to issue a special item [Voucher of Reciprocal Tides] which grants a free chance to obtain one 5-Star Standard Resonator of your choice via in-game mail on 05/26 10:00 (UTC+8). This event is available until 2025/05/22 11:59 (UTC+8). Please watch out for our in-game announcement regarding the detailed event rules.  
  
**(4) Further optimizations are scheduled along with more, fresh content**  
  
We have already scheduled further optimizations of the game and the development of new functions and gameplay elements down the pipeline. These include the optimization of the art assets of certain NPCs, a new layered map display function, and more Echo transformations. Please stay tuned.   
  
  
Please be assured that your voices and feedback are essential to us. If you have any issues, please reach out to our Customer Support via email at **[wutheringwaves\_ensupport@kurogames.com](&lt;wutheringwaves_ensupport@kurogames.com&gt;)**.

        <title>Announcement on &#34;Wuthering Waves&#34; 1.0 Version and Future Adjustment Directions</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/827" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Dear Rovers,  
  
Greetings, we are the Wuthering Waves Dev Team. Since the official launch of Wuthering Waves, we have received a lot of valuable feedback and suggestions through social media and in-game surveys. We are genuinely grateful for your attention and support.  
  
We apologize for the deficiencies and issues present in Wuthering Waves, our first fully independently developed and globally published game at Kuro Games. We understand that this has affected your gaming experience, and we are working to improve it for those who love the game.  
  
We have been working on optimizations and iterations for the current 1.0 version, and the development of subsequent version updates is also underway. Below, we will address some of the most discussed and concerned issues.  
  
  
  
**I. On the Echo Development Experience**  
  
**(1) Echo Development feels grindy and inadequate energy materials**  
  
We are aware of the common concern in the community that the current Echo leveling experience feels too  grindy and the game lacks a Waveplates storage system. We have confirmed and will implement the following adjustments while we are working internally on solutions to address other common concerns.  
  
1. In the current version, we will launch a limited-time Echo material double yield event &#34;Chord Cleansing&#34;;  
  
2. In version 1.1, we will adjust the progression system to reduce the Shell Credit costs of Echo development;  
  
3. In version 1.1, we will remove the reward cutscene of the Tacet Field;  
  
4. From version 1.1 and forward, the yield of Echoes and Echo development materials will be increased;  
  
5. In upcoming updates, we will introduce the Waveplates storage system.  
  
**(2) Regarding our handling of the reward system error when recycling developed Echoes**  
  
On May 29, 2024, we were notified of an issue with the Echo recycling system where the amount of Shell Credits players obtained when recycling developed Echoes was wrong. Since this is an issue that directly impacts the game&#39;s balance, we fixed this problem through an emergency live update on the same night and issued compensation to all players. As part of the measures to minimize the event&#39;s impact on the fairness within the player community, we informed the players of the situation and announced that we would remove all additional Shell Credits obtained unexpectedly as a result of this bug within 14 business days and issue compensations accordingly.  
  
However, due to the urgency of this issue, we failed to issue an announcement of this issue in the first instance, which regrettably caused negative experiences for our players. We sincerely apologize for our improper way of handling this situation and the inconvenience caused.  
  
Following an internal discussion, we have decided to compensate all players with the Shell Credit based on the maximum amount of Shell Credit that had been unexpectedly yielded through this bug to address the negative impact caused. We will round up to the nearest whole number and provide **extra compensation** to all players: **Shell Credit ×1,000,000**.  
  
**✦Distribution Time: By 23:59 on June 10, 2024 (UTC+8)**  
  
**✦Eligibility: Character created and mailbox function unlocked before 10:00 on May 30, 2024 (UTC+8). The compensation is valid until 05:59 on July 3, 2024 (UTC+8).**  
  
We apologize again for the hasty way we handled this issue and for any inappropriate wording in our announcements. We promise that all our future decisions shall reflect thorough consideration and professionalism.   
  
Additionally, to address the poor experience with the Echo system, we will compensate all Rovers with **Crystal Solvents ×20 (1 Crystal Solvent = 60 Waveplates)**. Thank you for your understanding and support!  
  
**✦Distribution Time: 10:00 on June 3, 2024 (UTC+8)**  
  
**✦Eligibility: Mail function unlocked. The compensation is valid until 05:59 on June 28, 2024 (UTC+8).**  
  
  
**II. On the Error in 5-Star Weapon Description**  
  
As has been discovered by our players, the description of the 5-Star Weapon &#34;Verdant Summit&#34; in the game in certain languages contained a mistranslation. Upon discovering this issue, we promptly corrected the description and issued compensations to all Rovers. We have also initiated a comprehensive internal review of the localized versions of the in-game texts across all the languages that we support. Any corrections or improvements made during the process will be included in the upcoming updates. We sincerely apologize for this mistake and want to reassure you that we&#39;re committed to continuously improving the quality of our localization to better the experience for all Rovers.  
  
In the meantime, we will offer **a one-time compensation of Forging Tides ×5** to all Rovers for the known localization issue.  
  
As we endeavor to constantly improve the localization quality across different languages, we encourage you to provide us with your comments or suggestions on improving the localization and the experience of players worldwide through in-game feedback channels or our Customer Support. Thank you for your patience and understanding.  
  
**✦Distribution Time: 10:00 on June 3, 2024 (UTC+8)**  
  
**✦Eligibility: Mail function unlocked. The compensation is valid until 05:59 on June 28, 2024 (UTC+8).**  
  
  
**III. On Version Events**  
  
We have received extensive feedback on the duration and rewards of the &#34;Overdash Club&#34; event. To address your concerns, we are currently in the process of redesigning the rules and reward schemes for the upcoming events and the immediate solutions are as below:  
  
1. We will introduce a new limited-time **special event: &#34;Wuthering Exploration&#34; to offer new rewards and content to improve your gaming experience**.  
  
**✦Event Duration: 2024-06-13 10:00 to 2024-06-27 03:59 (server time)**  
  
**✦Event Rewards: Astrites ×800 + Morphable Elite Class Echo I + Morphable Elite Class Echo II + Premium Tuner + Premium Sealed Tube**  
  
2. Moving forward, we shall ensure we make greater collective endeavors internally in designing the version events to improve the event content, quality, and rewards for your better experience.  
  
  
**IV. On Future Version Updates Timeline**  
  
Since the official launch of Wuthering Waves, we have received extensive feedback regarding the game&#39;s storyline, localization, and various other aspects. We have been listening closely and are grateful for the continued enthusiasm and support from our players, which has exceeded our expectations.  
  
To allow everyone early access to experience more content and features of Wuthering Waves in version 1.0, we have decided to advance the release of subsequent content in version 1.0, starting on **June 6, 2024, at 10:00 (UTC+8)**. This release will include the Companion Story &#34;Solitary Path&#34; for Resonator Yinlin, the Featured Resonator Convene event &#34;When Thunder Pours&#34; for Yinlin, the limited-time challenge event &#34;Alloy Smelt&#34; along with many more spin-off events and features.  
  
Wuthering Waves Version 1.0 will last until **June 28, 2024, at 05:59 (UTC+8)**, after which we will schedule a server downtime and implement the update for Wuthering Waves Version 1.1 &#34;Thaw of Eons&#34;, which will include a **new area &#34;Mt. Firmament,&#34; new Resonators &#34;Jinhsi&#34; and &#34;Changli,&#34; and a new boss &#34;Jué.&#34;**  
  
To compensate for any inconvenience caused by this version timing adjustment, we will issue compensation to all Rovers: **Radiant Tide ×10**. Thank you for your understanding and continued support. For detailed information on the event time adjustments, please refer to the in-game announcements.  
  
**✦Distribution Time: 10:00 on June 3, 2024 (UTC+8)**  
  
**✦Eligibility: Mail function unlocked. The compensation is valid until 05:59 on June 28, 2024 (UTC+8).**  
  
  
**V. On Combat and Control Experience Optimization**  
  
We have heard your feedback regarding the poor experience with autoaiming and auto lock-on, controls, key remapping requirements, and game feel design. Based on the issues that repeatedly come up in player discussions, we have identified the following issues and will address them accordingly, while working on a solution to other known issues not listed below.  
  
**(1) Autoaiming/Auto Lock-on and Camera Performance In Battle**  
  
In the recent updates, we have disabled the &#34;Combat Camera Correction&#34; feature on PC by default. We have also optimized the default values and ranges for combat camera settings.  
  
**(2) Bosses Existing Combat State Unexpectedly**  
  
1. In recent updates, we have optimized the aggro ranges for certain bosses, including &#34;Thundering Mephis,&#34; &#34;Crownless,&#34; &#34;Lampylumen Myriad,&#34; and &#34;Impermanence Heron&#34; and adjusted the prerequisites for enemies to leave the combat combat state to reduce abnormal disengagements.   
  
2. In upcoming updates, we will introduce a &#34;Disengagement Warning&#34; feature.  
  
**(3) Ghost Touch Issues on Mobile**  
  
1. In recent updates, we have expanded the anti-ghost touch area around buttons.  
  
2. Future versions will include further optimizations for mobile controls.  
  
**(4) Delayed Availability of Custom Keybinding Feature**  
  
1. In version 1.1, the prerequisite to unlock the &#34;Custom Keybinding&#34; feature will be lowered to Union Level 2.  
  
2. We will also introduce a new player tutorial for using the &#34;Custom Keybinding&#34; feature, and we will gradually support more custom keybinding options for both keyboard/mouse and controller modes.  
  
**(5) Controller Mode Experience Optimization**  
  
1. In version 1.1, we will remap the current controller shortcut of &#34;Open Chat&#34; to &#34;Open Map&#34; and add an option to invert the Y-axis.  
  
2. Future versions will support &#34;Controller Mode&#34; on mobile devices.  
  
**(6) Poor Game Feel Design and Impact Signification**  
  
In future versions, we will constantly improve the event signification and game feel design for characters and monsters, enhancing the overall combat experience and positive feedback during battles.  
  
  
**VI. On Other Contents**  
  
**(1) No Purchase Limits for Store Items Like &#34;Flour&#34;, Leading to Accidental Purchases**  
  
In recent updates, we have added a &#34;Weekly Purchase Limit&#34; for certain items in the store.  
  
**(2) Audio and Sound Effect Bugs**  
  
In recent updates, we have addressed issues regarding missing sound effects and excessively loud ambient sounds. We have completed some investigations and updates to fix these issues. We will continue to optimize the audio experience to provide a more immersive audiovisual experience.  
  
**(3) Performance Issues: Crashes and Instability**  
  
In recent updates, we have fixed crash and instability issues affecting certain devices. We are currently identifying the causes of other crash reports and will continue to implement fixes. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. We are committed to ongoing performance optimization. If you encounter related issues when gaming, please contact Customer Support for assistance.  
  
**(4) &#34;Depths of Illusive Realm&#34; Event Optimization and Updates**  
  
We have received numerous player feedback and suggestions regarding the &#34;Depths of Illusive Realm&#34; event in version 1.0. In the upcoming version 1.1 update, we will further improve this event and add new content, including more playable characters, new challenges, new mechanics, and new buffs.  
  
  
  
Apart from the adjustments mentioned above, we recognize that there are still many issues in the game that affect player experience. We are committed to listening to every single piece of feedback, continuously organizing, optimizing, and resolving these issues to make Wuthering Waves better.  
  
We will share and communicate future updates and optimization progress with you actively. Additionally, we will continue to gather player feedback through version surveys.  
  
Since Wuthering Wave&#39;s official global launch, we have been disheartened by our inability to provide a high-quality gaming experience to all Rovers. We understand that continuously releasing better versions and content is our goal and mission, and we will always strive to uphold them.  
  
Finally, we sincerely thank all Rovers for your continuous attention and unwavering support for Wuthering Waves.

        <title>Wuthering Waves Developer&#39;s Message Vol. 3: Version 1.1 Preview</title>
        <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/893" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
        <content type="text">Dear Rover,  
  
To give you a sneak peek into what we have in store for you in future updates, we&#39;ll share the latest adjustments we&#39;re making to the game via Developer&#39;s Messages before each new version&#39;s launch. We&#39;ll also use these messages to address common issues with the current version and share details on related optimizations and adjustments.  
  
Wuthering Waves Version 1.1 &#34;Thaw of Eons&#34; is right around the corner. Here&#39;s what to expect in the new version:

**✦Echo System✦**

**I. New Tuner Synthesis Feature**  
  
To address the issue of lower-grade Tuners piling up in your Backpack during the late game, we will be introducing the Tuner Synthesis feature in the Version 1.1 update. With this feature, you will be able to synthesize a certain number of Medium/Advanced Tuners into higher-grade Tuners using the Synthesizer.

**II. Increased Union EXP Reward for Unlocking New Echo Entries**  
  
To the leveling experience and unlock the late-game content earlier for all players, we have introduced Union EXP reward for unlocking new entries of Echoes as of Version 1.1.  
  
Additionally, we will retrospectively reward the Union EXP for the number of Echo entries you have unlocked during Version 1.0 after the update. The compensation will be distributed via in-game mail. Make sure to check your mail and claim the rewards in time!  
  
**III. Higher COST Range for Echoes Rewarded for Activity Points**  
  
We&#39;ve heard your feedback about the high variability in the COST range of Echo rewarded by gaining required Activity Points in Guidebook. To improve your experience, we have removed COST 1 Echoes from the Activity Points reward pool. Now only COST 3 – COST 4 Echoes will be rewarded as for Activity Points.  
  
After the Version 1.1 update, once you accumulate 100 Activity Points by completing the Guidebook tasks, you will receive a random Echo of COST 3 or COST 4 quality.  
  
**IV. Data Bank Level Cap Raised**  
  
After the Version 1.1 update, the level cap for the Data Bank will be raised to Lv. 21. After reaching Lv. 21, all Echoes dropped will be guaranteed to be of 5-Star Rarity.  
  
**V. New Fun in Mt. Firmament: Echo Transformation**  
  
Get ready for some fun! In select areas of Mt. Firmament, you can now transform into Echo &#34;Clang Bang&#34; to explore the area. Stay tuned for more creative Echo puzzles and challenges in future updates!

**VI. Other Optimizations**  
  
1. Removed Tacet Field reward collection animation. You may now collect the reward directly.  
  
2.  Lowered Shell Credit Cost for Echo leveling.  
  
3. Simplified the Cruisewing Challenge. We have slowed down the flying speed of the Cruisewing and extended the time limit to make the challenge more manageable. 

**✦Events and Other Rewards✦**

**I. New [Depths of Illusive Realm] Content: Dreams Ablaze in Darkness with Raised Event Rewards**  
  
In Version 1.1, we will be introducing a new [Depths of Illusive Realm] event called Dreams Ablaze in Darkness along with new mechanics such as Tokens, Symphony Rank, and different Memetic Tuning available for you to create your own powerful build. Furthermore, the total event rewards will be increased to 1000 Astrites.  
  
**II. New Area Exploration Event: Mt. Firmament Area Events**  
  
To help everyone better experience the new Mt. Firmament area, we&#39;ve prepared two exclusive area events for you: the area exploration event [Tales from Mt. Firmament] and the photo collection event [Traces of Mt. Firmament]. Complete these events to earn up to 800 Astrites, Premium Resonance Potions, Premium Sealed Tubes, and more.  
  
**III. Increased Convene Item Version Exchange Limit in the Item Exchange: Oscillated Coral Store**  
  
As of Version 1.1, you may redeem up to 7 of each of the following Convene Items, Radiant Tides, Forging Tides, and Lustrous Tides, in each installment of the Store.  
  
**IV. Preview of Other Special Events**  
  
Besides the optimizations and tweaks mentioned above, Version 1.1 is also bringing a bunch of other cool events your way: the 7-day login event [Gifts of Celestial Light], the featured commission event [Lollo Campaign], the featured combat event [Tactical Simulacra], the leveling material double drop event [Aftersound Abundance], the Echo double drop event [Chord Cleansing], and so on. Stay tuned for our official announcements for more event details.

**✦Map Exploration System✦**

**I. New Mt. Firmament Layered Map**  
  
Due to the complexity of Version 1.1&#39;s new map Mt. Firmament, we&#39;ve added the layered map feature to the area to help you better explore it. You can switch between different layers on the map for more detailed exploration guidance.  
  
\*Due to the volume of work involved in creating a layered map for all areas, the Layered Map for other areas in Jinzhou will be released in future updates.&#34;

**II. New Area Quest Progress**  
  
After the Version 1.1 update, you will be able to track your progress on Exploration Quests for the current area via Map - Exploration Progress.

**III. Expanded Detection Range for Lootmapper**  
  
To make it easier for players to track and find undiscovered Supply Chests nearby on the map, we will expand the detection range of Lootmapper after the Version 1.1 update. You can use and deploy the Lootmapper through the Utility wheel to search for nearby Supply Chests.

**✦Quest and Gallery System✦**

**I. New Resonator Gallery Feature**  
  
After the Version 1.1 update, you can check all the Resonators you have unlocked and their unlocked time in Gallery - Crossing Stars.  
  
**II. New Story Dialogue Gallery Feature**  
  
After the Version 1.1 update, you can check all dialogues of completed Main Quests and Companion Stories in Gallery - Main Story.

**III. Level Requirements Lowered for Some Main Quests**  
  
To unlock the late-game content early for all players, we will lower the level requirements for some Main Quests after the Version 1.1 update:  
  
The requirement to unlock Main Quest Chapter 1 Act 4: Clashing Blades will be lowered from Union Lv. 14 to Union Lv. 11. Main Quests Chapter 1 Act 5 and Act 6 will become available once the preceding chapter quests are completed.  
  
**IV. More Number and Types of Guidebook: Activity Points Quests**  
  
We&#39;ve heard your feedback about the limited ways to earn Guidebook - Activity Points. So, with the Version 1.1 update, we&#39;ll increase the variety and number of daily Activity Points tasks. We hope these changes make the quests more enjoyable for you.

**✦Other Experience Optimizations✦**

**I. New Combat Style Tags**  
  
With the Version 1.1 update, we&#39;re introducing Combat Style Tags to categorize the combat mechanics of different Resonators. We hope this will help you better understand each Resonator&#39;s core combat style.

**II. New Chat System Style**  
  
To make the chat system easier to use during gameplay, the chatbox will be displayed at a half-screen height after the Version 1.1 update.  
  
**III. Controller Mode Interaction Optimizations**  
  
1. Added a new camera adjustment setting for the controller mode. You can now invert the horizontal and vertical camera controls under Settings - Controls.  
  
2. Changed the controller mode shortcut key: Open Chat is now Open Map.  
  
3. Enabled key remapping for certain buttons on Sony PlayStation controllers, making it consistent with the remapping options available for Xbox controllers.

        <content type="text">✦Mt. Firmament✦  
  
A secluded island situated in the southeastern ocean of Jinzhou territory. Cloaked in mist, it obscures its connection to the secular world. Mt. Firmament serves as the ancestral homeland of Jinzhou inhabitants.  
  
Legend has it that Sentinel &#34;Jué&#34; descended here to guide them.  
  
Navigating its waters is treacherous due to the thick fog. To safely reach its shores, you&#39;ll need to wait for precise timing and the expertise of a &#34;Wayfinder&#34;.</content>
