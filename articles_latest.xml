                    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Rover,</p>
<p>To bring you exciting new content and a better gaming experience, we will soon be conducting the update maintenance for Version 2.6: By Sun&#39;s Scourge, By Moon&#39;s Revelation.</p>
<p>During the maintenance, you will be unable to log in to the game, so please plan your time accordingly. Additionally, due to the large size of the update, we recommend updating the game while connected to a Wi-Fi network. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<p><strong>[Maintenance Time &amp; Compensation Details]</strong></p>
<p><strong>✦Maintenance Time:</strong> <strong>2025-08-28 04:00 - 2025-08-28 11:00 (UTC+8)</strong></p>

<p><strong>✦Compensation Eligibility: Create a character and unlock the Mails feature before 2025-08-28 04:00 (UTC+8). The compensation can be claimed before the next version update.</strong></p>
<p><em>In the event that the maintenance is extended, the dev team will issue a follow-up notice and adjust the compensation accordingly.</em></p>
<p><strong>[How to Update]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once the maintenance for the version update begins, you can follow the following instructions to update your client.</strong></p>

<p><strong>[How to Pre-download]</strong></p>
