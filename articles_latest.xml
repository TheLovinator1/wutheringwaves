<p>Dear Rover,</p>
<p>To bring you exciting new content and a better gaming experience, we will soon be conducting the update maintenance for Version 2.5: Unfading Melody of Life.</p>
<p>During the maintenance, you will be unable to log in to the game, so please plan your time accordingly. Additionally, due to the large size of the update, we recommend updating the game while connected to a Wi-Fi network. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<p><strong>[Maintenance Time &amp; Compensation Details]</strong></p>
<p><strong>✦Maintenance Time: 2025-07-24 04:00 - 2025-07-24 11:00 (UTC+8)</strong></p>
<p><strong>✦Maintenance Compensation: Astrite x300, Crystal Solvent x2</strong></p>
<p><strong>✦Compensation Eligibility: Create a character and unlock the Mails feature before 2025-07-24 04:00 (UTC+8). The compensation can be claimed before the next version update.</strong></p>
<p><em>In the event that the maintenance is extended, the dev team will issue a follow-up notice and adjust the compensation accordingly.</em></p>
<p><strong>[How to Update]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once the maintenance for the version update begins, you can follow the following instructions to update your client.</strong></p>
<p><strong>✦PC: Close the game, restart the launcher, and then click on &#34;Update.&#34;</strong></p>
<p><strong>✦Android: Launch the game and follow the instructions in the update pop-up window to complete the update.</strong></p>

<p><strong>✦Android/iOS: 7 GB. Approximately 14 GB of storage space is needed for the decompression process. This space will be used only temporarily and will be freed up once the maintenance is completed.</strong></p>
<p><em>Please note that pre-download may not be possible if your device does not have enough spare storage space.</em></p>
<p><strong>[How to Pre-download]</strong></p>

<p><em>Please ensure that you have a stable network connection during the pre-downloading process.</em></p>

<p>Tethys&#39;s crisis simulation program is getting an upgrade. With newly gathered data from the Black Shores and Rinascita, even harsher scenarios now await those who dare to face the challenge…</p>
<h1>Duration</h1>
<p>2025-06-19 10:00 - 2025-07-23 03:59 (server time)</p>
<h1>Rewards</h1>
<p>Astrite x500, Virtual Vanquisher (Title) x1, Premium Tuner x200, Advanced Resonance Potion x25, Advanced Sealed Tube x20, Shell Credit x500000, and other Materials.</p>
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<p>Reach Union Level 30.</p>
<h1>Event Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As a member of the Black Shores, take on Crisis Trial challenges and Disaster Trial high-difficulty challenges under various combinations of Stress Modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Crisis Trials, select a Stress Level for each trial. The Stress Level must meet the requirements to complete the trial. Each trial has a default Stress Module. Support Modules are available to lower the trial&#39;s difficulty. After completing a Crisis Trial, the corresponding Disaster Trial along with its Stress Module and Support Module will be unlocked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disaster Trials have no required Stress Level. Participating in a Disaster Trial will consume Support Modules, so select them carefully in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain Matrix Crystals by achieving Challenge Objectives in the Crisis and Disaster Trials. Matrix Crystals can be exchanged for rewards at the Supply Station. The Supply Station closes when this event ends. Please exchange your Matrix Crystals in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completing certain Stress Level challenges in Disaster Trials will grant an event-exclusive Title &#34;&#34;Virtual Vanquisher.&#34;&#34;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Certain high-difficulty Stress Modules can only be unlocked after clearing a Disaster Trial. Warning: Equipping too many Stress Modules may make the trial excessively challenging.</em></p>
<p><em>If a participant is downed in a trial, they can consume Stress Levels to revive. This also gives a corresponding buff. Please note that consuming Stress Levels will affect the completion and final result of Challenge Goals.</em></p>]]></content>
