                    <title>[Tactical Simulacra: Off Tune] Featured Combat Event</title>
                    <link href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/3672" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
                    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/object/1764086400000/ldt3k8vm9hq09qzl7v-1764152839874.jpg" /></p>
<p>As the Tactical Simulacra project advances, the Huaxu Academy has successfully achieved the measurement of Tunability, a property through which countless Reverberations converge into Tacet Discords. Disrupting their Tunability would mean a lethal blow that paralyzes them...</p>
<h1>Duration</h1>
<p>2025-11-27 04:00 - 2025-12-15 03:59 (server time)</p>
<h1>Rewards</h1>
<p>Astrite x600, Premium Resonance Potion x16, Premium Energy Core x16, Premium Sealed Tube x16, Premium Tuner x100, Shell Credit x608888, and other Materials.</p>
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<p>Reach Union Level 14.</p>
<h1>Event Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Tactical Simulacra: Off Tune, challenge waves of powerful enemies using special buffs across different simulation domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tactical Simulacra: Off Tune has a total of 6 stages. Reach 1000 points in a stage to unlock the next one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you complete more challenges, new special buffs will be available to you in the subsequent challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The results of each challenge will be tallied based on Monster Points, Time Points, and Technical Points. Monster Points are earned by defeating enemies in challenges; Time Points are earned based on the time remaining at challenge completion and a conversation factor that increases with the number of enemies that are defeated; Technical Points are earned by triggering Counterattacks, successful Dodges, and Dodge Counters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In Tactical Simulacra: Off Tune, some of your attacks build up certain enemies&#39; Off-Tune Level. Once their Off-Tune Level reaches the limit, they enter the Mistune state. During this state, you can unleash a powerful Tune Break to shatter their defenses. Landing a Tune Break resets the enemies&#39; Off-Tune Level and inflicts Tune Disruption, leaving them vulnerable to follow-up attacks.</em></p>]]></content>

<p><strong>[Version Update Details]</strong></p>
<h1>New Resonators</h1>
<p><strong>5-Star Resonator: Chisa (Havoc/Broadblade)</strong></p>
<p>&#34;Just an ordinary student.&#34;</p>
<p>Calmly, she introduces herself, a faint iridescent shimmer flickering in her eyes. Again, the structures of the world reveal themselves in her vision. Narrowing her eyes, she singles out the very thread that tugs at life itself.</p>
<h2>Combat Roles: Support and Healer, Resonance Liberation DMG, Havoc Bane</h2>
<p><em>Obtainable through the [Horizon of Dawnbreak] Featured Resonator Convene.</em></p>
<p><strong>4-Star Resonator: Buling (Electro/Rectifier)</strong></p>
<p>Taoist of Mengzhou, Black Shores Consultant, feng shui master, and veteran forum dweller.</p>
<p>Easygoing and well-traveled, Buling will &#34;bling&#34; whatever you seek.</p>
<h2>Combat Roles: Support and Healer, DMG Amplification, Resonance Skill DMG Amplification, Electro Flare</h2>
<p><em>Obtainable through the [Requiem Without End] and [Neptune&#39;s Lullaby] Featured Resonator Convene. After the event ends, starting from the next version, 4-Star Resonator Buling will be permanently available in Featured Resonator/Weapon Convene and Standard Resonator/Weapon Convene.</em></p>
<p><em>4-Star Resonator Buling will be simultaneously made available in the Afterglow Coral Store and will be removed at the end of the next version.</em></p>
<h1>New Weapon</h1>
<p><strong>5-Star Weapon: Kumokiri (Broadblade)</strong></p>
<p>A crimson thread emerges in the void, as if binding the structures of all things onto a single thread.</p>
<p>At her fingertips, the endless season is drawn taut, snipped, and rewoven, until the scattered path at last converges once more upon this timeline.</p>
<p><em>Obtainable through the [Absolute Pulsation - Kumokiri] Featured Weapon Convene.</em></p>
<h1>New Area</h1>
<p><strong>Chronorift Metropolis</strong></p>
<p>A ruined city, like amber trapped in the Sonoro. Once-bustling streets lie overgrown with wild grass, low roads swallowed by seawater. The Lament repeats endlessly, and time and space are fractured, but this view seems frozen, stopped in a silent eternity.</p>
<p><em>Reach the location during Main Quest Chapter II Act XII &#34;Stagnant Dawn on Wastelands.&#34;</em></p>
<h1>New Echoes</h1>
<p>Nightmare: Roseshroom, Nightmare: Tick Tack, Nightmare: Dwarf Cassowary</p>
<p>New Nightmare Purification challenge: Honami City Nightmare Nest</p>
<p><em>In Nightmare Purification, a set number of Nightmare Tacet Discords are available daily. Defeat them to claim the corresponding Echoes without spending Waveplates.</em></p>
<h2>New Sonata Effect: Thread of Severed Fate</h2>
<p>Thread of Severed Fate (3pcs Set): Inflicting Havoc Bane increases the Resonator&#39;s ATK by 20% and grants 30% Resonance Liberation DMG Bonus for 5s.</p>
<h1>New Stories</h1>
<p><strong>[Main Quest] Chapter II Act XII &#34;Stagnant Dawn on Wastelands&#34;</strong></p>
<p>With events in Rinascita finally over, you return once more to the Black Shores to find them investigating abnormal frequencies in nearby waters. During the investigation, you are pulled into the rift and soon awaken in a ruined, restless city. And as the situation grows dire, a mysterious black-haired girl appears before you… At this point, where time is frozen, sever the endless loop and embrace the dawn of the future.</p>

<p>After the crisis in Honami City was resolved, Chisa received treatment at the Black Shores. You&#39;ve been apart ever since. Now, it&#39;s time to visit her again.

<h1>Features</h1>
<p>**</p>
<h2>Negative Statuses**</h2>
<p><strong>Adjusted the effects of Havoc Bane, Fusion Burst, Glacio Chafe, and Electro Flare.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Havoc Bane]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some Havoc attacks will apply a stackable Havoc Bane effect to the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Havoc Bane lasts, the DEF of the inflicted target is reduced. Havoc Bane stacks up to 3 times by default, with each stack reducing the target&#39;s DEF by 2%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[Fusion Burst]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some Fusion attacks will apply a stackable Fusion Burst effect to the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Fusion Burst is stacked to its max, all stacks will be removed to trigger an explosion, dealing Fusion DMG around the target. Fusion Burst effect stacks up to 10 times by default. The higher the stacks, the more DMG dealt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[Glacio Chafe]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some Glacio attacks will apply a stackable Glacio Chafe effect to the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Glacio Chafe is inflicted, the target receives Glacio DMG. Glacio Chafe stacks up to 10 times by default. The higher the stacks, the more DMG dealt. Each stack of Glacio Chafe effect reduces the target&#39;s Movement Speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Glacio Chafe reaches max stacks, the target will be frozen, and all stacks of Glacio Chafe will be removed. Struggle to accelerate your recovery from the frozen state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[Electro Flare]</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some Electro attacks will apply a stackable Electro Flare effect to the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Electro Flare lasts, it deals periodic Electro DMG to the target. The target loses half of the effect stacks with each instance of damage. Electro Flare stacks up to 10 times by default. The higher the stacks, the more DMG dealt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At maximum stacks of Electro Flare, any new stack inflicted becomes stackable Electro Rage. Electro Rage increases the DMG dealt by the next Electro Flare trigger. Electro Rage is removed once triggered. Electro Rage stacks up to 10 times by default. The higher the stacks, the more DMG Electro Flare deals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
