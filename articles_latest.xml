<p>Its frequency, once bound by the Sentinel&#39;s shackles, was reborn through the Gem. Taking the form of the once Blessed Maiden, Fleurdelys, It made Itself a vessel anew.</p>
<p>Born of the yearning for life and sustained by the eternal dread that haunts all living beings, It gazes unceasingly, silent as the abyss.</p>
<p>All heretics and non-believers shall stand before Its judgment.</p>
