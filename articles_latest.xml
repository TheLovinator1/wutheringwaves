<p>When the Drive&#39;s immune response is triggered, a mechanized &#34;Reactor Husk&#34; will arise from the depths of the energy well, with the sole purpose of eliminating intruders at all costs.</p>
<p>Research by Spacetrek Collective shows that Reactor Husk was once part of the Exostrider. Both share a mission to resist the Threnodian threat and safeguard civilization.</p>

<p>The Research Institute implanted the Exostrider&#39;s space-time error correction module runtime into Hyvatia&#39;s core, allowing Hyvatia to adjust the Exostrider&#39;s orbit and detect hidden spaceborne threats with high precision. Therefore, Hyvatia possesses sufficient computational power to predict the Reactor Drive&#39;s rotation.</p>
<p>Hyvatia&#39;s core function is to detect abnormal or dangerous energy fluctuations, perform immediate emergency calibrations, and feed this data back to the Drive to ensure stable operation.<img alt="" src="https://hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/object/1767542400000/nhzo07ndoetofjec5w-1767579707949.jpg" /></p>

<h2>How to Participate</h2>
<p>In order to successfully complete the <strong>V3.0 WUWA Discord Quest</strong>, players who meet the eligibility criteria must live stream their <strong>Wuthering Waves</strong> gameplay to a friend via a Discord voice channel for a minimum duration of 15 minutes on the desktop app.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before you can begin the Quest, launch the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, head to your Discord desktop app and navigate to a direct message (DM), group chat, or a server of your choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once there, start a voice call or join a voice channel and select the <strong>Screen</strong> <strong>Share</strong> icon located in the voice status panel. Be sure to select the individual application for the game before you Go Live.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: You must select the game application to stream! Streaming your device’s screen will not progress your Quest forward. Once you stream, you can check the progress bar on the Quest Home to ensure progress is being made on the Quest.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>When you’re ready to stream your gameplay, press <strong>Go Live.</strong> You can learn more about streaming your game <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151-Go-Live-and-Screen-Share#h_01HFFJ28PJAY9AHGRQ85XRSF8G">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Redemption Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Once you have completed the Quest by streaming 15 minutes of Wuthering Waves, you will receive a reward code in Quest Home (Discovery &gt; Quests). For detailed instructions on how to claim your reward code, please refer to our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/22225719947543-Discord-Quests-FAQ#h_01HVPBZR5FKKSQ3R1JXB9E4DM3">Discord Quests FAQ</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select your server and enter Wuthering Waves, and then go to [Settings] - [Other] - [Redemption Code].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the [Redemption Code] and hit [Confirm] to redeem rewards. You can then claim them in your in-game mail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Redemption Code] function will be unlocked once you&#39;ve reached Union Level 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Redemption Code obtained in this event will expire on 2026/02/05 at 15:59 (PT). Redemption Codes that expire will be unable to be redeemed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Discord Quest FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Is there a limit on how many Quests I can redeem on my Discord account?</strong></p>
<p>A: Eligible users can redeem one of each of the available Quest campaigns on their Discord account.</p>
<p>For more information on Discord Quests, visit our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/22225719947543">Discord Quest Help Center</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is this feature/promotion available in my region?</strong></p>
<p>A: Some Quests will not be available in all regions based on terms and conditions. If you are in an ineligible region for a Quest, you will not be able to complete it.</p>
<p>Additionally, Discord’s premium services are restricted in some regions. If you are unable to access the Gift Inventory, you are not eligible for Quests.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I have concerns or questions regarding privacy and Quests.</strong></p>
<p>A: We encourage you to review <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Discord’s Privacy Policy</a> for further details about how we use your information. You can head over to our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/22225542459415">Data Used for In-Game Rewards</a> article, to learn more about how we use data for Quests.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why am I unable to complete Quest while using Linux?</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently, Quest rewards are unable to be earned on Linux devices.</p>
<p>However, Discord team is looking into a resolution for this issue so that earning Quest rewards is possible on Linux in the future. For now, we recommend completing the requirement on a different operating system, like Windows or MacOS.</p>
<p>Discord support team does not have an exact ETA for when a solution will be available, and won&#39;t be able to provide any status updates on this specific issue.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I no longer see a Quest. Where did it go?</strong></p>
<p>A: Quests are typically only available for a limited amount of time. If you no longer see a Quest in the Quest Home or in-app notifications about the quest, the period to complete and claim the reward for the Quest is over.</p>]]></content>
