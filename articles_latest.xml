<h2>Discord Quest FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Is there a limit on how many Quests I can redeem on my Discord account?</strong></p>
<p>A: Eligible users can redeem one of each of the available Quest campaigns on their Discord account.</p>
<p>For more information on Discord Quests, visit our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/22225719947543">Discord Quest Help Center</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is this feature/promotion available in my region?</strong></p>
<p>A: Some Quests will not be available in all regions based on terms and conditions. If you are in an ineligible region for a Quest, you will not be able to complete it.</p>
<p>Additionally, Discord’s premium services are restricted in some regions. If you are unable to access the Gift Inventory, you are not eligible for Quests.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I have concerns or questions regarding privacy and Quests.</strong></p>
<p>A: We encourage you to review <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Discord’s Privacy Policy</a> for further details about how we use your information. You can head over to our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/22225542459415">Data Used for In-Game Rewards</a> article, to learn more about how we use data for Quests.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why am I unable to complete Quest while using Linux?</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently, Quest rewards are unable to be earned on Linux devices.</p>
<p>However, Discord team is looking into a resolution for this issue so that earning Quest rewards is possible on Linux in the future. For now, we recommend completing the requirement on a different operating system, like Windows or MacOS.</p>
<p>Discord support team does not have an exact ETA for when a solution will be available, and won&#39;t be able to provide any status updates on this specific issue.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I no longer see a Quest. Where did it go?</strong></p>
<p>A: Quests are typically only available for a limited amount of time. If you no longer see a Quest in the Quest Home or in-app notifications about the quest, the period to complete and claim the reward for the Quest is over.</p>]]></content>

                    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Current archives and Royan tales speak of the Exostrider, who descended through the Stridergate buried deep within Lahai-Roi. Down along its trail came Threnodian Aleph-1, and the two clashed in a fierce battle. At last, the Exostrider sealed Aleph-1 within the Stridergate itself. The Exostrider then drove its greatsword into the earth to hold up Lahai-Roi and the Roya Frostlands above.</p>
<p>Current research suggests the Exostriders and Sentinels were created with technology from the same civilization.</p>
