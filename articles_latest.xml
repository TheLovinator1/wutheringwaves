<p><strong>[Version Update Details]</strong></p>
<h1>New Resonators</h1>
<p><strong>5-Star Resonator: Augusta (Electro/Broadblade)</strong></p>
<p>Ephor of Septimont. The undying sun eternally ablaze, and a banner under which defeat does not exist.</p>
<p>She comes. She sees. She conquers.</p>
<p>With blade held high, she awaits the next challenger or the fate that claims it cannot be defied.</p>
<h2>Combat Roles: Main Damage Dealer, Heavy Attack DMG, DMG Amplification</h2>
<p><em>Obtainable through the [Eternal Radiance on the Crown] Featured Resonator Convene.</em></p>
<p><strong>5-Star Resonator: Iuno (Aero/Gauntlets)</strong></p>
<p>She is favored by fate under one name, and swept away by it in another.</p>
<p>Yet never once has she been defeated, nor has she ever yielded.</p>
<p>Now, witness the defiant Priestess. Witness what keeps her striding forward, never to look back. Witness how she walks the intricate web of destiny and becomes the only answer.</p>
<h2>Combat Roles: Support and Healer, Concerto Efficiency, Resonance Liberation DMG, Heavy Attack DMG Amplification</h2>
<p><em>Obtainable through the [Across Time&#39;s Waxes and Wanes] Featured Resonator Convene.</em></p>
<h1>New Weapons</h1>
<p><strong>5-Star Weapon: Thunderflare Dominion (Broadblade)</strong></p>
<p>Thunder shall purge her pain and weakness. From the crucible of blood and sand, the Sun rises. Not dimmed by dust, but ablaze in her full radiance.</p>
<p><em>Obtainable through the [Absolute Pulsation - Thunderflare Dominion] Featured Weapon Convene.</em></p>
<p><strong>5-Star Weapon: Moongazer&#39;s Sigil (Gauntlets)</strong></p>
<p>By what means do all things endure? By light and heat, by matter and word, by the mechanics of converging chances, by the soft dissolution into silence, by a moment that mimics the eternal... All things rise and fall in endless rhythm, each bearing its meaning. As for hers, it lies here within her grasp.</p>
<p><em>Obtainable through the [Absolute Pulsation - Moongazer&#39;s Sigil] Featured Weapon Convene.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hunter&#39;s Growl Series (4-Star): Aureate Zenith (Broadblade), Feather Edge (Sword), Solar Flame (Pistols), Aether Strike (Gauntlets), Radiant Dawn (Rectifier)</strong></p>
<p>The engravings draw inspiration from Griffrexes—natural-born hunters and the first allies Septimontians found in this land. Their bond needs no words, radiant and pure, like the blazing sun that watches over all.</p>
<h2>※To obtain a 4-Star Hunter&#39;s Growl weapon, purchase and unlock the Insider Channel or Connoisseur Channel of the Pioneer Podcast to obtain a Pioneer Podcast Supply Pack, and open the Pack to claim one Hunter&#39;s Growl weapon of your choice.</h2>
<h1>New Area</h1>
<p><strong>[Sanguis Plateaus]</strong></p>
<p>The Sanguis Plateaus serve as both Septimontians&#39; hunting grounds and the first line of defense against the Dark Tide. On these magnificent yet bleak highlands, the Blightcloud hovering above stirs relentlessly.</p>
<p>Here, power and glory reach their peak, then give way to bloodshed and death.</p>
<p><em>Reach the location during Main Quest Chapter II Act VIII &#34;By Sun&#39;s Burning Hand.&#34;</em></p>

<p><em>A set number of Nightmare Tacet Discords are available daily. Defeat them to claim the corresponding Echoes without spending Waveplates.</em></p>
<h2>New Sonata Effects: Crown of Valor, Law of Harmony</h2>
<p>Crown of Valor (3pcs Set): Upon gaining a Shield, increase the Resonator&#39;s ATK by 6% and Crit. DMG by 4% for 4s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.5s and stacks up to 5 times.</p>
<p>Law of Harmony (3pcs Set): Casting Echo Skill grants 30% Heavy Attack DMG Bonus to the caster for 4s. Additionally, all Resonators in the team gain 4% Echo Skill DMG Bonus for 30s, stacking up to 4 times. Echoes of the same name can only trigger this effect once. The record of Echo triggering this effect is cleared along with this effect. At 4 stacks, casting Echo Skill again resets the duration of this effect.</p>
<h1>New Stories</h1>
<p><strong>[Main Quest] Chapter II Act VIII: By Sun&#39;s Burning Hand</strong></p>
