You can check if you're qualified via the following methods:</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">1. Go to the CBT2 Qualification Inquiry Page and log in with the credentials you provided when you filled in the recruitment questionnaire. Then click \"Check Qualification\" to see if you're qualified.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">&gt;&gt;&gt;<span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><a style=\"color: #ba372a;\" href=\"https://wutheringwaves.kurogame.com/en/cbt\">https://wutheringwaves.kurogame.com/en/cbt</a></span></span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">2. Check the email you provided in the recruitment questionnaire. Qualified Rovers will be notified via email.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">3. Rovers who gained the CBT2 qualification by other means (community events, for example) will be contacted via DM for further information after the events end. Please check your DM for messages from our verified official accounts.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">NOTES:</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">1. The CBT2 Qualification email will be sent from no-reply-wuthering-waves@email.kurogame.com so they might be put in your \"spam\" or \"subscription\" folders. Please make sure to check them.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">2. All the game content in CBT2 is still under development and does not represent the final quality of the game.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">3. There will be no voiceover for the main story in CBT2. When Wuthering Waves officially launches, English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese dubbing languages will be available. The developer team will strive to bring you better voiceover quality. We appreciate your support and understanding!</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">4. Sharing, lending, giving away, transferring, or selling test qualifications, accounts, clients, and other related actions are strictly prohibited during CBT2. Any users found engaging in such behaviors will have their qualification cancelled. To ensure the security of your personal information and assets, we remind you not to believe or engage in any activities related to sharing/trading of qualifications, account sharing/trading, or selling of test packages. This will help you avoid unnecessary losses.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">We will make another announcement once we have completed distributing all CBT2 Qualifications. Please stay tuned!&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">Thank you again for your continued attention and support!</span><br /><br /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: 微软雅黑;\">Wuthering Waves Dev Team</span></p>\n</div>",
