Though she carries a relaxed and gentle aura, she becomes determined and resolute when making promises. This has earned her the role of a dependable big sister figure, despite her age.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Taoqi's lazy nature is evident in her lifestyle &mdash; she always carries a heating eye mask for impromptu naps on soft surfaces like beds or sofas. She loves dozing off while leaning on her friends' shoulders.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1703606400000/d2n4nlgqw9s1zjdd65-1703659525671.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" /></span><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #e03e2d;\">Taoqi</span></strong><strong style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">'s</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #e03e2d;\">&nbsp;Trouble</span></strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Known as a trustworthy and caring big sister, Taoqi is often sought out for advice. From career to relationship issues, people confide in her, leading some to label her the \"Gossip Queen.\"&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">In fact, Taoqi simply listens and observes, offering guidance to those who seek it. She has no interest in spreading rumors or using others' words for entertainment, instead focusing on helping them solve their problems.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #e03e2d;\">Taoqi's Work-life Balance</span></strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Taoqi believes in maintaining a clear boundary between work and personal life for success.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Nothing stops Taoqi from getting off work on time. Once she clocks out, she is unreachable and colleagues only find her notes. She would be in the comfort of her home, organizing the day's tasks while resting on her trusty Peachy Turtle pillow. She will not fall asleep until she has made sure everything is in order.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">At work, Taoqi excels in efficiency and attention to detail, earning a reputation for reliability among her colleagues. Her ultimate dream is a future with less work and more relaxation. But for now, she remains dedicated to protecting the city of Jinzhou. Until her goal is achieved, Taoqi will continue her vigilant approach to safeguarding the community and ensuring peaceful days for all.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1703606400000/rdxa2sguep9wty317k-1703659586879.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" /></span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">The Unhurried Guardian</span></strong></span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Taoqi is known for her slow and deliberate movements. However, this same quality has made her a strong and dependable protector.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">As a child, she faced bullying for her pace but found solace in those who patiently waited for her. As she grew up, she eventually found her strength in slowness to protect the ones she cherished.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">As an adult, Taoqi uses keen observation and thoughtful planning to safeguard the people of Jinzhou. Her deliberate nature is not a weakness; instead, it has allowed her to establish a reliable defense system for the city.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Though not one for frontline battles, she diligently works in the background, orchestrating defense strategies and supporting civilians. Her strength lies in bringing peace to chaotic situations and protecting those she cares for.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">But when needed, Taoqi can hold her own in combat with skill and precision.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #e03e2d;\">Taoqi's Fighting Style</span></strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">As a reassuring presence in the team, Taoqi excellently assumes the responsibility of the protector. Much of her ability goes under her unique defense mechanisms. Use her ability wisely, and then every member of the team will be protected.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #e03e2d;\">Normal Attack</span></strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Taoqi may seem laid-back, but her prowess in battle is unmatched. With her broadblade, she effortlessly lands consecutive strikes.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Taoqi's heavy attack allows her to switch to a special Parry state. In this state, she can mitigate incoming damage.</span><br /><br /><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1703606400000/9bwj1lfiblzt0enzyy-1703659634182.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"350\" /><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #e03e2d;\">Resonance Skill</span></strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Taoqi deals aerial damage to nearby enemies, restoring HP and generating shields around herself.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">When the currently on-filed character is attacked, a shield is consumed to absorb the damage taken.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Additionally, when Taoqi is attacked, her Forte Gauge increases from the shield consumed.</span><br /><br /><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1703606400000/lywtvxzbrez6kb6q1c-1703659664965.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"350\" /><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #e03e2d;\">Forte Circuit</span></strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Once Taoqi's Forte Gauge is sufficiently charged, her next heavy attack is enhanced.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">With this enhanced heavy attack, Taoqi immediately unleashes a powerful counterattack against any incoming enemy attack, and she gains shields afterwards. This ends Taoqi's Parry state.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Her following basic attacks consume the remaining Forte Gauge to give her and her teammates shields that mitigate damage.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #e03e2d;\">Resonance Liberation</span></strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">In the midst of battle, Taoqi remains true to her lazy demeanor. She yawns before wielding her blade for a powerful, wide-range slash that deals Havoc damage. The outburst of energy also generates a special force field that slows down enemies within its confines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1703606400000/u8zzfm9y2nqfz2atud-1703659781438.gif\" /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>",
