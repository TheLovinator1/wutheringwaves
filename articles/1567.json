With Version 1.4: When the Night Knocks just around the corner, it's time for another installment of Wuthering Waves Developer's Message. In this update, we're adding new gameplay elements, an exciting new feature, and optimizations to enhance your experience.</span><br><br><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">✦New Gameplay Elements✦</span></strong></div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">New Combat Mechanism: Dream Link</span></strong><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Dream Link is a new combat mechanism that will be introduced in the Main Event of Version 1.4. Dream Link enhances the synergy between your Resonators, allowing them to unlock their true potential together. When certain conditions align during combat, Dream Link will activate, dramatically amplifying your team&rsquo;s combat prowess.</span></div>\n<div><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/object/1730476800000/2qrwkfhsg0r5a0lcg2-1730549346360.gif\" data-desc=\"succ\"></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Overdrive Combat: Illusive Sprint</span></strong><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">In the Main Event of Version 1.4, you can pick up the white cat's blessings to enter the Illusive Sprint state that increases your moving speed. Lumi, a Resonator who will make her debut in the new version, has a similar ability. When certain requirements are met, instead of dodging, Lumi dashes to get out of harm's way and is capable of attacking enemies while moving at high speed.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/object/1730476800000/84mbx8uv9m13824f5e-1730553152762.gif\" data-desc=\"succ\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/object/1730476800000/0vjkw134zkhmmux0hz-1730553153718.gif\" data-desc=\"succ\"></span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">These two new gameplay mechanisms will be available in the Main Event of Version 1.4. Once the Main Event concludes, it will be added as a Permanent Event, where the same gameplay mechanisms will still be available.</span><br><br><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">✦New Feature✦</span></strong><br><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Weapon Cosmetics: Weapon Projection</span></strong><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">With Version 1.4, we&rsquo;re introducing an exciting new customization feature: Weapon Projections. This feature lets you transform the appearance of your weapons without affecting their stats, allowing you to create a look that&rsquo;s entirely your own.&nbsp;</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">※ Participate in the Main Event of Version 1.4 to obtain a free Weapon Projection associated with the event featured 4-Star Sword.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Additionally, we are adding Transparent Weapon Projections, available for all five weapon types. You can use a Transparent Weapon Projection to turn the equipped weapon completely or partially invisible. We hope these new options let you add even more personality to your Resonators&rsquo; looks, whether you're exploring or capturing moments in photos.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">※ Participate in Version 1.4's Depths of Illusive Realm to obtain a complete set of Transparent Weapon Projections for free.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">※ Equip a Transparent Weapon Projection to make Rectifiers and Gauntlets completely invisible, or turn Swords, Broadblades, or Pistols partially transparent.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/object/1730476800000/j7h6nm17r6vcfqk37n-1730549485154.gif\" data-desc=\"succ\"><br></span></div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">✦Gaming Experience Optimizations✦</span></strong></div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Leveling-related Optimizations: Double Rewards, Step-by-Step Echo Upgrade</span></strong><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">To enhance your long-term gaming experience, Version 1.4 will introduce a series of leveling-related optimizations as part of an ongoing project. In this update, you&rsquo;ll be able to Fast Travel directly to the location of any Tacet Suppression or Boss challenge via the Map.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Additionally, you&rsquo;ll have the option to spend double the Waveplates to earn double rewards upon completing a Forgery, Simulation, or Tacet Suppression challenge. We've also improved the display of Results Screens, giving you a clearer view of the rewards you've earned.</span></div>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/object/1730476800000/o256dxv18boai6expq-1730549523872.jfif\" width=\"899\" height=\"505\" data-desc=\"succ\"><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Last but not least, in Version 1.4, you can conveniently upgrade an Echo to the exact levels that unlock new substats (5/10/15/20/25) through the Auto-Select Settings. We hope this change can improve your Echo Upgrade experience and efficiency.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/object/1730476800000/cj5vd86giqh2ckkhof-1730549600864.jfif\" width=\"901\" height=\"507\" data-desc=\"succ\"></span></p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Interface-related Optimizations: Waveplate Info Pop-up, Echo Info Pop-up, Tower of Adversity Interface Adjustments</span></strong><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Starting from Version 1.4, whenever you log into the game, you'll receive a pop-up displaying the amount of Waveplates and Waveplate Crystals you own.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/object/1730476800000/2p52zo6ttzmzdu4ebd-1730549652294.jfif\" width=\"898\" height=\"505\" data-desc=\"succ\"></span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">The displayed information for a newly absorbed Echo will also be optimized. Upon absorption, the Echo's Sonata Effect category will be displayed along with its Mainstat and Substat.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/object/1730476800000/lf6am15c26x79b0q78-1730549681811.jfif\" width=\"895\" height=\"504\" data-desc=\"succ\"></span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">In the current version, adjusting your team lineup in the Tower of Adversity requires leaving and re-entering, which we know can interrupt your gameplay experience. To improve this, we've optimized the interface in the upcoming version, allowing you to view and adjust your team directly within the Tower.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Apart from the above, more optimizations are in the pipeline, along with more gameplay elements and features. Please stay tuned!</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">※ All content shared in the preview is still in development and may not represent the final quality.
