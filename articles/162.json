Rovers must also be eager to learn more about the trio of Resonators who they would initially meet at the very start of their journey. So, we hope to share our notes, to help Rovers understand more about them.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /></p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Yangyang</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">1.1 Like wind flowing at your side</span></strong></span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The first character for the Rover to know in the world of Wuthering Waves, Yangyang will be the starting member on your team as you set on the journey. She plays key parts in upcoming stories, as well.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Utmost gentleness is going to be the impression of Yangyang in her long companionship going forward.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1677168000000/nla43rg7zajhnc9uri-1677215267914.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even in this land of pain and destruction, there are still ones keeping their maximal kindness \"naively\", of whom Yangyang is an embodiment. She endeavors to find the perfect solution out of the impossible; She dedicates herself to the defense of all the goodness, even sometimes at the cost of herself.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Being gentle never means ever-surrendering tolerance; on the contrary, it brings great power. That warrants a natural depth and a contradiction to Yangyang's personality: she must be tough and even obstinate to be a practicer of kindness.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Of course, this comes at an expense. On the journey, Yangyang might face crises and loss due to her character.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">1.2 The Skylark that praises beauty</span></strong></span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The images of Wind and Feather. They leave the impression of light and soft. Under some conditions, however, they may show unexpected strength.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These two images come close to Yangyang's way of being gentle: a soothing, innocent girl in ordinary times, but a warrior like howling winds during fights.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This extends our imagination and reminds us of Percy Shelley's To a Skylark: \"Languor cannot be ... Thou lovest, but ne'er knew love's sad satiety\".</span></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1677168000000/7ak1bqw05fzo47bzon-1677215308964.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Skylark is not a peculiar kind of bird like Fenghuang or eagle, but it is an idealization, a praise for beauty and happiness.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">May Yangyang bring solace to you just like a skylark, in this world of surging tides of sounds.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">1.3 Gentleness: Key to Yangyang's Image</span></strong></span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Gentleness might be one of the classic tags of a character that is most common but most difficult to define, especially for Yangyang, as she is not \"weak\" in the way people would generally tell of a gentle character.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">With that in mind, when Yangyang was being put into shape, we hoped she could shine more different lights to catch your attention, except from the above-mentioned images of skylark and feather.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For example, a sense of first love. Yangyang's general impression is warming, just like your childhood sweetheart, who has been here so long, that you will always recall the first sight of her, no matter how far you have gone, or how many faces you have met.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another role she plays is a listener who senses the breezes. Yangyang is not someone of strong mood swings; instead, she listens quietly, and feels closely. She connects to the wind, in her way.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hence, a girl soothing like the wind and yet strong in her senses, came to Rover's side.</span><br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Chixia</span></strong></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">2.1 Chixia Is Gonna Light Up Your World!</span></strong></span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In an overall depressing world, there is a passionate and candid companion, unfearful of letting her emotions be heard, accompanying Rover carrying out more and more exciting adventures going forward.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By featuring eye-catching bright red colors in her appearance, along with a backward-tied sprout, all of which manifests the passionate and high-spirited characteristics of Chixia.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1677168000000/alctdv2oiiuvkdb018-1677215343397.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Chixia's outfit bears a rather bold style similar to collage and cut-out arts. During battles, parts of her outfit flutters with the wind as she performs actions, further highlighting the superb pistol-wielding skills of Tiancheng's favorite hero.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1677168000000/4vwt3f3ix1yzlmiusd-1677215369191.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Chixia features various distinctive personal traits, such as fondness towards spices, and cherishing of the macram bracelets she wears from her home, etc. These reflect her status of being a migrant to Tiancheng, which in turn draws out a detailed and complete worldview of Huanglong.</span></p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">2.2 Chixia? Or Ma Xiaofang?</span></strong></span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Throughout the history of Huanglong, many migrants from various regions of the nation moved to Tiancheng. The Ma family was one of the many.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As Xiaofang pursues her hero dream, she always wanted a renowned nickname of her own, just like those from the plays, to boost confidence when in need. Hence the nickname \"Chixia\", Blazing Dawn.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But of course, besides these \"glorified excuses\", the real reason behind the nickname contains notions of Xiaofang's own personal motives. Which is something that is left for Rover to discover.</span><br /><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1677168000000/cigazemqekj92923y2-1677215391624.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">2.3 Chixia's Hero Dream</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Having witnessed her own courageous father fighting for his nation, the regular visit to hero-themed plays during her childhood, and even the valiant atmosphere among the Tiancheng population resisting the Wuthering Waves, all played a part in the illumination of Chixia's passion for heroism.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A hero can be many forms, whether it be a distinguished warrior possessing the might to turn the tides of battle, or an unsung servant who gives in silence yet asks for nothing in return.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For Chixia, the word \"hero\" means someone who can face their fears head on, someone that's able to safeguard those in need during critical times. No matter family, friends, or any other person requiring assistance, Chixia is always the first to step forward.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By exploring a variety of directions, Chixia ultimately chose to pursue this path in mind. She is a vibrant figure for the entire Tiancheng to view.</span><br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Bailian</span></strong></span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">3.1 A Cold Archaeologist</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As one of the three companions Rover would meet early on in the journey, Bailian is a rather cold and reserved person when compared to the gentleness of Yangyang and the enthusiastic Chixia.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Not only a \"Cold Beauty\" who distances herself from others, as an archaeologist of the Huanglong Academy, Bailian's personality also bears the rationality that of a scientist.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1677168000000/ckdg50xl9qpshhrdtr-1677215446890.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus, due to having extreme rationale, Bailian features some peculiar traits. One of which is showing meticulous attention to details, not being able to stand descriptions such as \"a touch of oil\" within cooking recipes, and instead she will precisely measure the amount of ingredients needed using a proper scale...</span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">3.2 The Birth of You'tan</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">You'tan is a Remnant symbiotically connected with Bailian. It obeys Bailian's commands, and is able to reflect her physical condition to a certain degree.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Bailian was once left in a life-threatening situation, one which downright demolished her trust of other human beings, leading to You'tan's birth in the process. In Bailian's own words, You'tan is \"a copy of myself\".</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rather to have trust in others, Bailian is more willing to trust You'tan. You'tan also seems to possess powers of inversion, embodying Bailian's kindness and will within itself.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">3.3 Diving Into Bailian and You'tan's Appearances</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Similar to her name \"Bailian\", White Lotus, Bailian's appearance shows hints of her cold personality. Her clothing style features simple yet elegant black &amp; white coloring.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the other hand, Bailian is a lady of action who would more than often explore archaeological sites personally. Therefore, her outfit is rather close-fitting and function orientated, at the same time not lacking in Huanglong characteristics in its detailing.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1677168000000/wfgaeuxbs8aoufheyd-1677215481093.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">You'tan presents an airy and streamlined overall appearance, showing matching elegance to that of Bailian. The many mysterious petal-like patterns that surround its body can also be seen as an echo to its master's name.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://dev-hw-media-cdn-mingchao.kurogame.com/akiwebsite/images/1677168000000/8deguwpe5hq31je6w1-1677215501409.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The entirety of You'tan&lsquo;s tail section is hollow, which extends a sound spectrum acting as the connection with Bailian. You'tan's personalities can also be examined during combats and interactions with Bailian.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Three Resonators, three distinct personalities. Even more mysteries around them await Rovers. Encounter and discover them in person. Subsequently, we will continue to unravel the world for Rovers to perceive.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>",
